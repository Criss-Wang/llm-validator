History of Present Illness:
HPI: 74 y/o male with hx of CAD, HTN, s/p PM for sick sinus
syndrome, CRI s/p nephrectomy who was recently discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] [**2124-1-18**] now returns from OSH after being intubated for CHF,
initially hypotensive after lasix given then became hypertensive
and also found to have + blood from NGT.
.
During previous admission patient admitted for abdominal pain
underwent EGD and c-scope and found to have multiple
diverticulae and gastritis.  Shortly after EGD patient had
respiratory failure was intubated thought to be [**1-14**] CHF,
extubated the next day.  Patient also thought to have NSTEMI
which was medically managed and patient eventually discharged
[**2124-1-18**].
.
Patient presented to OSH with presumed CHF after being
hypertensive and was intubated.  Per daughter patient missed his
blood pressure medications the day of admission.  Patient denies
any fever,chills, coughs or gradual SOB prior to event.  He
recieved lasix at home and then en route however still SOB in ED
so was put on Bipap and then intubated.  During his admission at
OSH his BP has been labile with hypertension SBP 190s.  Patient
started on nitro gtt for BP control and got lopressor 5mg x3.
At OSH CXR showed initially diffuse infiltrates c/w pulmonary
edema vs PNA; repeat CXR the following day showed improved
infiltrates.  Patient's peak TropI was 1.8 and CK 68 at OSH.
EKG done at OSH showed pattern c/w LVH and more pronounced ST
depression in lateral leads.  Repeat EKG done on arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**] was similar to old EKGs.  Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] patient on
minimal vent support with well controlled BP on nitro gtt.

P-MIBI ([**2124-1-27**]):
No anginal symptoms with an uninterpretable ECG for ischemia.
There is a mild fixed perfusion defect involving the inferior
and inferolateral walls.  The left ventricle is moderately
dilated at stress and rest and there is global hypokinesis with
a calculated LVEF of 35%.
.
TTE ([**2124-1-24**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF 50%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2). Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) eccentric mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

2.0 cm cyst of the right renal lower pole.  Otherwise, normal
appearance of the right kidney with patent vasculature and no
son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of
renal artery stenosis. Surgically absent left kidney.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 41957**] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU intubated.  Upon
arrival, he had a favorable ABG and wsa quickly extubated
without difficulty.  His BP was intially controlled with a
nitroglycerin drip which was slowly weaned off over the first
night of his hospitalization.  On the morning of hospital day
#2, he became acutely short of breath with acute development of
pulmonary edema at the same time that his blood pressure
suddenly rose to 220-240/100-120.  He was given IV Lasix and
metoprolol and his nitroglycerin drip was quickly titrated back
up.  He was put on BiPAP with improvement in his oxygenation.
Over the course of the day, he was weaned easily off BiPAP.  The
focus at this point became controlling his hypertension which
was done with a high dose of Toprol XL, increasing his dose of
Imdur, and starting him on amlodipine.  He was temporarily
controlled on PO hydralazine but this was titrated off due to
his history of poor medication compliance.  His history of a
nephrectomy precluded the use of an ACEi or [**Last Name (un) **].  As far as
working up the etiology of his refractory hypertension, a renal
ultrasound showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis and a
random cortisol level was within normal limits; a 24-hour urine
collecion had normal levels of VMA and metanephrines.  For his
presumed coronary artery disease, he underwent a pharmacologic
stress test which showed only a mild fixed defect in the
inferior/inferolateral walls along with an LVEF of 35%.  He was
discharged home to stay with his daughter with plans to follow
up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of cardiology.

Brief Hospital Course:
35 yo F w/significant psych Hx and multiple suicide attempts,
admitted unresponsive, presumably after OD. (Most likely
Fioricet.)  Now extubated, off pressors.
.
1) Tylenol Overdose: Level 267 on admission, decreased to 0
within 24h.  In the ED she received activated charcoal and
mucomyst 10g PO. Mucomyst was continued for 11 doses total
(stopped when LFTs showed no sign of increase above normal).
Coags and LFTs remained wnl.  Mucomyst then discontinued.
.
CXR suggested pneumonia, possibly related to aspiration, so
clinda was started.  Mental status improved and the patient was
extubated on HD #2.
.
2) Barbiturate Overdose: Pt was found unresponsive and intubated
in the field.  By HD #2 mental status was improving and pt was
extubated.  By the time of discharge mental status was normal.
Pt was kept on a CIWA scale and monitored for signs of
withdrawal throughout hospital course.  Vital signs remained
stable.
.
3) Hypotension: Initially hypotensive with SBP in the 60s.  On
levophed for BP support with good response, but then weaned off
after fluid resuscitation.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test had an inadequate
bump, but hypotension had already resolved so steroids were not
started.  Monitored bp which remained stable and was 115/79 on
day of discharge.
.
4) Aspiration pneumonia: Bibasilar consolidation noted on CXR.
Will continue treatment with clindamycin for 7 days (day [**1-8**]).
.
5) Asthma: Continued inhalers.
.
6) Psych/suicide attempt: Psychiatry followed patient during
hospital stay.  Pt had a 1:1 sitter throughout hospital course.
Risperidone was given prn for anxiety.  Patient will have
psychiatric hospitalization for suicide attempt after discharge
from medical service now that patient is medically cleared.
.
7) Proph: PPI, SC heparin was discontinued due to PTT elevation,
PTT then normalized.
.
8) Code status: Full
.
9) Dispo:  Patient medically cleared on [**2142-7-20**] for transfer to
psychiatric care.  She is afebrile, temp 97.2, heart rate 68, bp
117/79 and oxygen saturation 97% on room air.  Her Tylenol level
is now undetectable and LFTs within normal limits.  Aspiration
pneumonia treated with Clindamycin and to complete 7 day course

and bronchiectasis.  Following this procedure and discharge, he
continue to have a single episode of hemoptysis (teaspoon full).


He was subsequently readmitted on [**8-1**] [**Hospital3 6783**] after a
second episode of hemoptysis, [**2-16**] of a cup. Upper endoscopy
showed a gastric ulcer in the fundus, 80% healed. During this
hospitalization, he developed massive hemoptysis on [**8-3**],
which was bright red blood with tissue, about 600 cc.  He was
unresponsive and was intubated. He was transfused 1 unit.
Bronchoscopy was performed and showed no clots in the bronchus.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2117-8-4**] by the thoracic surgery
service to the SICU for treatment and evaluation of massive
hemoptysis. ENT evaluated the patient for bleeding sources:
Fiberoptic exam revealed no source of blood from the nose,
nasopharynx, oropharynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx or larynx;
there were no supraglottic lesions.

CTA on [**8-5**] showed a Left superior segment coiled AVM with an
adjacent ground glass opacity.  It was thought that this finding
could represent intraparenchymal hemorrhage or it could
represent aspiration, given the dependent consolidation seen in
both lower lobes and the secretion seen in the right main
bronchus. Imaging also revealed a question of a completely
thrombosed aorta just distal to the origin of the renal arteries
with extensive collaterals in the abdominal wall musculature.
Due to this finding, ultrasound of the aorta was performed.
While a suboptimal study due to bowel gas, arterial flow and
normal waveforms was noted is seen in the right and left distal
most external iliac arteries and common femoral arteries
bilaterally consistent with a prior femoral-femoral bypass.

On [**8-5**], flexible bronchoscopy with narrow-band imaging and
therapeutic aspiration was performed. A fresh blood clot was
identified in the right lower lobe lateral segment which was
therapeutically aspirated. A clot was also identified left
main-stem and this was emanating from the left lower lobe. There
was evidence of possible pulmonary AVMs in the left main-stem
medial segment; however, this was compounded somewhat by the
traumatic appearance of the airways. Under white-light imaging,
these
areas appeared erythematous. No other definitive AVMs were noted
under narrow-band imaging. On [**8-6**], a repeat flexible
bronchoscopy was performed to isolate a source of bleeding.There
was a small clot on the right main stem, however, there were no
clots or active bleeding in the right upper lobe, right middle
lobe, right lower lobe.  The left main stem again had a
questionable area of erythema, possible
arteriovenous malformation in the medial aspect of the left main
stem.  The left upper lobe and lingula were free from clots or
blood.  There was an old blood clot emanating from left lower
lobe, which was therapeutically aspirated.  Upon
examination, the anteromedial segment of the left lower lobe
demonstrated a fresh clot with active oozing of blood, which was
confirmed with a bronchial wash.  The posterior and lateral
segment of the left lower lobe were both washed and
there was no active oozing. The final impression was that the
Left lower lobe anteromedial segment is likely source of
hemoptysis.

The patient was taken to the angio suite on [**8-6**] for possible
embolization. A preliminary report revealed: 1. Aortogram
demonstrating no visualized bronchial artery branches. 2.
Selective angiograms of intercostal arteries demonstrating no
irregularity. 3. Subclavian arteriogram demonstrating no
abnormality of the left internal mammary artery. No intervention
was performed.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**8-7**], and kept for
observation. The patient had several more episodes of hemoptysis
on [**8-8**] - 2 tsp of bright red blood without clots - which
resolved without intervention. On the evening of [**2034-8-7**], the
patient had no episodes of hemopysis.

The Interventional Pulmonology team, staff and patient agreed
that is was appropriate to discharge the patient to home on [**8-9**]
with follow as needed. The patient is being discharge stable, in
good condition.

Mr [**Known lastname 1274**] was in chronic afib that was difficult to control and
his metoprolol was advanced.  He was re-started on coumadin on
POD 2.  A rub was noticed and he was started on Ibuprofen.The
remainder of his postoperative course was essentially
unremarkable. [**9-22**] due to an elevated WBC ct. blood and urine
cultures were sent and empiric antibiotics were started. Urine
Cx originally positive and sensitive to ABX but repeat finalized
negative. The  WBC ct improved to normal and his temp.remained
afebrile, at time of discharge blood cultures were pending, it
was decided to continue a full week of antibiotic coverage. He

Postbypass: Preserved biventricular systolic function. LVEF 55%.
Intact thoracic aorta. No new valvular findings.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from
outside hospital after cardiac cath revealed severe coronary
artery disease. Upon admission he was medically managed and
underwent pre-operative work-up. On [**1-20**] he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary arterty bypass
graft x 4. Please see operative note for details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. His awoke from sedation hemodynamically
stable and was weaned from the ventilator and extubated. He was
started on betablockers, lasix, ASA and statin therapy. CT and
temporary pacing wires were removed per protocol. He was
evaluated by physical tehrpay for strnegth and conditioning. On
3 separate occasions when he was walking on the stairs he became
hypotensive w/ SBP 70's-80's and diaphoretic. His medications
were adjusted and he was given 2 UPRBC for post-op anemia( HCT
22) with stabilization of his hemodynamics. An ECHO was done
without evidence of pericardial effusion. CXR revealed a
moderate left effusion which has responded to diuresis. On POD#
6 he was cleared for dischrge to home and all follow up
instructions and appointments were advised.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] was born at 34 and
5/7 weeks gestation by cesarean section for nonreassuring
fetal heart rate to a 35 year-old gravida 5 para 2 now 3
woman.  Prenatal screens are blood type A positive, antibody
negative, Rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis surface
antigen negative and group B strep unknown.  This pregnancy
was complicated by an abnormal alpha fetoprotein study with a
normal amniocentesis.  The antepartum course was otherwise
uncomplicated until rupture of membranes on the day of
delivery.  Mother presented in spontaneous labor, which was
augmented with pitocin.  She had an antepartum fever of
100.4.  The infant emerged with spontaneous cry.  Apgars were
8 at one minute and 8 at five minutes.  The birth weight was
2175 grams.  The birth length 47 cm and the birth head
circumference 29 cm.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Active premature infant.
Anterior fontanel soft and flat.  Positive bilateral red
reflex.  Breath sounds course that were slightly diminished
on admission, but improving.  Heart was regular rate and
rhythm.  No murmur.  Abdomen soft.  Distended testes
bilaterally.  Mongolian spot over sacrum.  Stable hip
examination.  Symmetric tone and reflex.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory status:  The infant required
oxygen by nasal cannula until day of life number two when he
weaned to room air where he has remained.  He has not ever
had an apnea or bradycardia.  On examination his respirations
are comfortable.  His lung sounds are clear and equal.

Cardiovascular status:  He has been normotensive throughout
his Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay.  there are no
cardiovascular issues.

Fluid, electrolyte and nutrition status:  Enteral feeds were
begun on day of life number one and advanced without
difficulty to full volume feeding by day of life number four.
At the time of discharge he is feeding breast milk or Enfamil
20 calorie per ounce.  The mother has visited only a few
times during his Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay and so has
had limited experience with breast feeding the infant.  At
the time of discharge the weight is 2400 grams, the length is
47 cm and the head circumference 32 cm.

Gastrointestinal status:  The last bilirubin done on day of
life number three was 5.7 total at direct 0.3.  The infant
never required any phototherapy.

Hematological status:  The infant never received any blood
product transfusions.  His hematocrit at the time of
admission was 45.7.

Infectious disease status:  [**Known lastname **] was started on Ampicillin
and Gentamycin at the time of admission for sepsis risk
factors.  The antibiotics were discontinued after 48 hours.
Blood cultures were negative and the infant was clinically
well.

Sensory:  Audiology, hearing screen was performed with
automated and auditory brain stem responses and the infant
passed in both ears.

Psycho/social:  Parents speak Mandarin and we have
communicated with them with a interpreter during their
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay.

The infant is discharged home in good condition.  Primary
pediatric care will be provided by [**Hospital3 **] Community
Center, [**Location (un) 48869**]in Quinsy, [**State 350**].  Parents
plan to call on Monday the 14th to schedule an appointment.

CARE/RECOMMENDATIONS:  Feedings, breast feeding or formula 24
calorie per ounce on an ad lib schedule.  Medications, iron
sulfate (25 mg per ml elemental iron) 0.2 cc po q day.  The
infant passed a car seat position screening test.  The last
state newborn screen was sent on [**2140-5-7**].  The infant
received his first hepatitis B vaccine on [**2141-4-30**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post prematurity at 34 and 5/7 weeks.
2.  Status post transitional respiratory distress.
3.  Sepsis ruled out.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 52157**] was admitted on [**2180-3-8**] and taken to the operating
room for a right [**Last Name (un) 5884**] flap reconstruction.  She tolerated the
procedure well with only 150 mL of estimated blood loss.  She
was sent to the ICU after the procedure where she underwent
frequent flap checks that revealed good doppler pulses
consistently.  The right aspect of the flap appeared to be
somewhat congested the following morning and she was treated
with leech therapy to reduce this congestion.  The right aspect
of her flap remained somewhat eccymotic but continued to be warm
with good doppler signals.  We removed her foley on POD 2 and
she was able to void.  She tolerated a regular diet and
ambulated appropriately.  She was discharged home in good
condition with a visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 19843**] checks and dressing
changes on POD 5.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CHF exacerbation: On arrival in the ED, her O2 sats was 75%
on RA, BP 128/78 (which increased to 180/68), 68, and RR 12
(increased to 24). She was placed on BiPap with increase in O2
sat to 91%. CXR indicative of pulmonary edema. Received total of
120 mg IV Lasix with good diuresis, nebs prn, ceftriaxone 1 g
IV. When her BP increased to 180s, she was begun on a nitro gtt
and also received hydralazine 10 mg IV x1. Her bp later dropped
to 80/40, and her nitro was turned off with good BP response.
She was also noted to have non specific lateral ST segment
depression on EKG, with serial negative cardiac enzymes.  Pt
maintained on lasix 80 mg po QD with decent response (~1L net
neg per day).  Did require a few doses of IV lasix 80 mg to
maintain this urine output.  She was also placed on lopressor
and her dose was titrated up to 25mg po TID.  Her heart rate is
in the 60's and she likely has some baseline SA dysfunction
based on her age (i.e. sclerosis), but the further rate control
should help her diastolic filling in addition.  This CHF exac
likely [**3-12**] lingular PNA, pt recieving ceftriaxone and
azithromycin for community acquired pneumonia.  Clinda was added
to cover for possible aspiration.  Will d/c for total of 10 day
course of antibiotics.  On the 8th hospital day, her antibiotics
were changed from IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin to PO
levaquin.  The patient now denies SOB, orthopnea or cough.  She
is able to ambulate with help.  She may need 1-2 L O2 by NC at
[**Hospital3 **] to keep her O2 sat betwwen 90-93%.

2.  ST changes: Evaluated by cards in ED. Liekly demand
ischemia, with ST depressions transiently. TTE with no wall
motion abnormalities. Patient was placed on BB for both
decreased myocardial demand and for decreased inotropy and
chronotropy with regard to diastolic dysfunction.  No further
risk stratification was done to the patient since no
intervention would be done in the case of abdnormal result.

3.  DVT: Dx'd [**5-13**].  Pt was supratherapeutic with an INR >8sec
on admission.  Coumadin was held until [**10-29**] when re-institued.
She takes 6mg Tuesdays and Fridays, and 4mg the rest of the
weekdays.  Her coumadin will be managed at [**Hospital3 2558**].  The
coumadin clinic was made aware of this.

4.  Anemia:  Pt is iron deficient.  She will be discharged with
oral ferrous gluconate.  She recieved no blood transfusions.
Her pending iron studies will be followed up by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 665**].

5.  Fall:  The patient fell from a mechanical fall with no LOC.
She had a negative head CT.

6.  Pul Hypertension:  The patient has a chart history of OSA.
She has severe pulmonary arterial hypertension consistent either
with OSA or chronic PE.  She is anticoagulated for prevention of
PE, and our pretest probability for PE while being
anticoagulated is low such that she does not require [**Location (un) **]
placement.  She may need a sleep study to determine if she has
OSA.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 59 y/o female who presented today to an
outside hospital after experiencing an increasingly severe
headache for the past 4 days. The patient has had two syncopal
events over the past year (most recent episode in early [**Month (only) 958**]).
The patient had an episode of vomiting 4 days ago and has had
worsening headache since that time. The headache has caused the
patient to remain in bed for most of the day. The patient's
husband notes that the patient has been more somnolent over the
past couple days in addition to some gait unsteadiness. Head CT
at the outside hospital demonstrated a significant right frontal
brain mass associated with mass effect and shift. She was given
10 mg of IV decadron and 1 gram of dilantin at the outside
hospital and was transeferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.


Past Medical History:
hypothyroidism, s/p tubal ligation

Social History:

Family History:
no family history of intracranial malignancy

Physical Exam:
A&O x 3. EOMs intact. Face symmetric.
Motor [**4-18**] throughout.
Sensation intact throughout.
Toes downgoing bilaterally.

Pertinent Results:
CT head [**4-15**]:
FINDINGS: Patient is status post stereotactic brain biopsy of
right frontal cystic lesion, and Ommaya shunt device is now seen
in place, with reservoir in the right frontal subcutaneous
tissues, and catheter extending into the lesion, with tip seen
just lateral to the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
There is a small amount of expected post-surgical
pneumocephalus. There is a tiny amount of curvilinear density
seen anterior to the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral
ventricle, which likely represents a small amount of
post-procedural hemorrhage. There is no sign of new or large
intracranial hemorrhage. Vasogenic edema in the right frontal
lobe is unchanged. 8-mm leftward subfalcine herniation is
largely unchanged. Right uncal herniation is unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post stereotactic brain biopsy and placement of Ommaya
shunt in large cystic lesion in the right frontal lobe.
Unchanged vasogenic edema, leftward subfalcine herniation, and
right uncal herniation.
2. Expected post-procedural pneumocephalus. Tiny amount of blood
anterior to right lateral ventricle, but no new large
intracranial hemorrhage.

MRI head [**4-14**]:
FINDINGS: When compared with a prior study, again there is
evidence of a large approximately 4 x 5 cm right frontal cystic
mass lesion associated with vasogenic edema and subfalcine
herniation to the left (approximately 1.2 cm of shifting is
noted). After the administration of gadolinium contrast, there
is evidence of ring-enhancing pattern in this lesion with some
irregular areas and possible septations. On the magnetic
susceptibility, there are low signal areas suggesting
calcifications or blood products. On FLAIR sequence, there is
evidence of some scattered hyperintense foci and possible
transependymal migration of CSF on the left occipital
ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. There is also evidence of effacement of the
right perimesencephalic cisterns and right uncal herniation.
Normal flow void signal is identified on the vascular
structures. The orbits, the paranasal sinuses appear within
normal limits, patchy hyperintensity signal is identified on the
mastoid air cells bilaterally, more evident on the left.

IMPRESSION: Large cystic mass lesion is identified on the right
frontal lobe with evidence of ring-enhancing pattern at
irregular contour in the base of the lesion with septations and
possible hemorrhagic blood products or calcifications. The
possibility of a primary cystic lesion is a consideration, a
metastatic lesion cannot be completely ruled out.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was started on mannitol and decadron upon admission.
Her neuro status improved slightly after the mannitol was
started. On [**4-15**] she had a steriotactic brain biopsy, drainage of
cystic mass, and placement of Ommaya shunt. Her post-op CT scan
was stable. On [**4-16**] she was transferred to the floor. Due to her
improved mental status, the mannitol was weaned off. The patient
was eating, drinking, and ambulating on her own prior to
discharge. She was sent home on [**2140-4-18**] after her MRI.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68553**] was admitted and underwent hepatic artery aneurysm
repair under general anesthesia with a tohoracic epidural on
[**2146-6-16**]. He tolerated the procedure well, was extubated and was
transfered to the CVICU postoperativey. He was hemodynamically
stable but did have some brief episodes of bradycardia which
resolved on their own. On POD 1 he was noted to have some
elevated LFTs, as expected. He was quite stable and was
transfered to the VICU for further recovery. In the vicu he
remained hemodynamically stable with good pain control. On POD 2
he tolerated a clear liquid diet and was OOB with assistance. A
nutrition consult was obtained given his recent weight loss and
preoperative status of having poor nutrition. He was advanced to
a regular diet on POD 3 with ensure supplements which he
tolerated well. He was transfered to the floor on POD 3 as well.
On POD 4 his epidural was removed. He tolerated PO pain meds
quite well. Later that day his foley was removed, and he voided
a small amount, however, by the evening he had not voided in
several hours and a bladder scan showed over 800cc of residual,
hence a foley was re placed. He was also started on flomax . His
jp drain was also removed on POD 4 without difficulty. He was
hemodynamically stable and able to ambulate without assistance.
On POD 5 he was tolerating his diet well and felt comfortable
with his foley and leg bag. He was evaluated by PT and found
stable to go home. He will follow up with his PCP on friday for
foley removal.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 55-year-old man
with multiple medical problems including insulin dependent
diabetes secondary to severe pancreatitis in [**2123**], remote
history of Hodgkin's disease in [**2113**] treated with among other
things, radiation therapy which has left the patient with
severe osteoporosis and resulting compression fractures,
history of alcohol abuse, on chronic opioids for residual
pain secondary to pancreatitis, who presented on [**12-26**] with
delta MS.

Per the patient's lifetime partner, the patient self
increased his dose of opiate using approximately four patches
of Fentanyl and increasing his Seroquel dose from 150 to 300
mg.  He presented to the ED on [**2135-12-26**] with increased
weakness, tremor, disorientation x2 months, worse over the
prior three days.

In the ED, the patient's temperature was 98.4, blood pressure
was 136-145/60-70.  His heart rate was 71-130.  He was
treated with Ativan 7 mg for what they thought was alcohol
withdrawal, which increased the patient's sedation and
subsequently his systolic blood pressure decreased to 88-97.
Patient had a negative head CT.  A lumbar puncture was
attempted, but was not successful.  Patient was started on
acyclovir, Vancomycin for empiric meningitis coverage.  The
patient's Chem-7 at that time was significant for a glucose
of 354, an anion gap of 13, 15 ketones in his urine.  With
these results, the ED started the patient on an insulin drip.

His blood gas initially was 7.23/55/46, but then decreased to
7.16/56/260.  The patient was minimally alert at this time.
He had progressive somnolence.  Patient was then started on
BiPAP 10 of 5, and was admitted to the MICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD.
2. Diabetes mellitus insulin dependent secondary to chronic
pancreatitis.
3. Chronic alcohol induced pancreatitis status post
debridement.
4. History of alcohol abuse.
5. Osteoporosis.
6. CHF with an ejection fraction of 40%.
7. Hodgkin's disease status post XRT, chemotherapy,
splenectomy.
8. Hypothyroidism.
9. GERD.
10. Vocal cord paralysis.
11. Chronic pain on multiple narcotics.
12. Anxiety and depression.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient has a 40 pack year history of
tobacco.  No recent ethanol use.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 98.5, blood pressure 104/64,
heart rate 107.  Cardiovascular:  Patient has a 3/6 systolic
murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border and at the
apex.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, multiple
surgical scars.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing, or
edema.  Pulses are [**12-30**]+ bilaterally.  Neurologic:  The
patient responds to commands, is moving all four extremities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the MICU for
further management.  On [**2135-12-27**], he was intubated due to
increased somnolence and hypoxia.

On [**2135-12-28**], an EEG was performed, which was read as
possibly consistent with encephalitis.  Patient was then seen
by the Neuro team, who recommended a MRI and LP.

On [**2135-12-28**], the patient's temperature spiked to 101.6.  He
was continued on ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir for
possible meningitis.  He was also started on a bicarb drip
for metabolic acidosis.  The patient was initially treated
with Ativan for narcotic withdrawal, but then this was D/C'd
and he was later started on a lower dose of Fentanyl.

On [**2135-12-29**], the patient was transferred to the VICU.
Analysis of the CSF fluid revealed 2 monocytes, 15
lymphocytes, 1 band.  Gram stain was negative for PMNs,
macrophages, or bacteria.  Culture was negative.  PCR for
Listeria and HSV were negative.

Results from the patient's MRI on [**2135-12-28**] revealed normal
brain parenchyma.  No blood breakdown or edema present.
Overall impression was that the MRI was grossly normal,
however, the study was limited by patient motion.

In the MICU, the patient was extubated.  His mental status
continued to improve.  He was continued on antibiotics for
treatment of presumed community acquired pneumonia.  He was
noted to have eosinophilia, which improved over the course of
his hospitalization.  He was transfused with 1 unit of blood
and transiently went into pulmonary edema in the setting of
this transfusion.  This resolved with Lasix and nebulizers.
Acyclovir was D/C'd as the patient's MRI and lumbar puncture
were negative.

The patient was then transferred to the medical floor, where
he was alert and oriented, able to ambulate with cane, and
was tolerating good p.o. intake.  He was seen by Physical
Therapy, who felt that he would benefit from a rehabilitation
stay.

History of Present Illness:
Briefly, 85 yo woman w/ transfusion dependant myelofiborisis,
diastolic CHF, small bowel AVM's, chronic venous insufficiency
who was transferred from rehab for anemia on [**11-16**] (HCT 21).  In
ED CXR showed early RLL infiltrate w/ pulm edema and she was
admitted to Medicine w/ dx of symptomatic anemia, aspiration
PNA, and CHF.  She was treated w/ IVF's, PRBCs, and 40mg lasix
IV, and was placed initially on levoflox and flagyl for presumed
aspiration PNA.  On HD #2 patient found to be hypotensive,
tachycardic, febrile, increasing O2 requirement after receiving
40 mg IV lasix, and was treated with IVF's, dopamine, ceftaz and
levo and transferred to the MICU.  Concern was for sepsis
(fever, low WBC, tachycardia thought to be sedondary to PNA) vs
hypotension, but the patient responded well to IVF boluses and
PRBC's, and pressors were weaned off by HD #3.

The pt denies dyspnea, chest pain. She does report recent
increase in LE edema and orthopnea. She denies any recent fever,
chills, weight loss, chest pain, palps, cough, abd pain,
dysuria, melena, and hematochezia.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 85 yo woman w/ transfusion dependant
myelofiborisis and diastolic CHF was sent from rehab to ED for
treatment of HCT 21. On arrival in the ED, T 96.3, BP 104/54, HR
95, O2 sat 92% RA-->98% 2L/m. A CXR showed an early RLL
infiltrate and pulmonary edema. She was admitted to Medicine
with a diagnosis of symptomatic anemia, aspiration PNA, and CHF.
She was treated w/ 3L NS, 2units PRBCs, and 40mg lasix IV. The
day after admission, she had temp of 100.0 and was treated with
levoflox 250mg IV and flagyl 500mg IV. UOP was 1600cc overnight.


At 3:45pm the next day, the patient was given lasix 40mg IV. 35
minutes later she was found to have BP 75/39, HR 120, RR 24, and
O2 sat 96% on 2L--> 100% NRB. Temp at that time was 101.8
rectal. She was treated w/ 1L NS, dopamine by PIV, and ceftaz
2gm, and levaquin 500mg. Within the hour, BP increased to 92/34,
HR 110. The MICU team was then consulted for evaluation.  The
patient was transferred to the MICU for treatment of possible
sepsis thought most likely secondary to PNA.  She was treated
with vanocmycin and ceftaz.

The patient was transferred out the floor.  Her antibiotics were
switched to vancoycin and ceftriaxone with a plan to treat for a
10 day course.  She was gently diuresed with lasix 10mg IV QD.
We continued to transfuse for hct<21 and platelets<15.

The patient continued to have increasing amounts of rectal
bleeding thought secondary to internal hemorroids in the setting
of platelets <20.  A GI consult was called.  The patient refused
an exam, but the GI team advised continuing to give platelets
and PRBC.  On [**2131-11-20**], the patient chose to change her code
status from full code to DNR/DNI.  Later that day, the patient
began to have hematuria and [**Date Range **] tingled sputum.  Her breathing
became more labored.  She improved with lasix and morphine, but
continued to become intermittently hypotensive and was again
spiking fevers.  A family meeting with the patient and her son
lead to a decision to make the patient CMO.  All treatments
other than lasix/morphine/and ativan were stopped.  The patient
was started on a morphine drip on [**2131-11-22**] and passed away on
[**2131-11-23**].  The family was notified and refused autopsy.

intubated.  Chest x-ray w/ bilateral interstitial infiltrates.
Etiology likely multifactorial including ARDS secondary to
pancreatitis/retained products of conception and pulmonary edema
given cardiac EF of 35%.  Over the course in the ICU, the
patients pulmonary status rapidly improved w/ diuresis. She was
extubated on HD 3. On HD 5, she was transferred to the floor on
6L nasal cannula. She continued to receive gentle diuresis while
on the floor. By HD 6, she only required 3L nasal cannula and by
HD7, she had oxygen saturation of 96-99% on Room Air. She no
longer received diuresis on her last hospital day. On discharge,
her oxygen saturation was 98-99% on Room Air. She will have a
follow up [**Month/Day/Year 113**] in [**12-20**] weeks to evaluate for resolution of her
cardiomyopathy.

2. Fever - the likely source of the patient's fever was
pancreatitis and/or the her retained products of conception. The
patient was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics
including zosyn, clindamycin, and doxcycline. As culture data
returned her antibiotic regimen was weaned appropriately. On HD
7, she was changed from IV meds to po levo/flagyl for possible
pneumonia vs myometritis. Since she had no
laboratory/radiological evidence of either condition, her
antibiotics were stopped on HD 8. She remained afebrile off of
antibiotics.

3. Pancreatitis - On admission, the patient was kept NPO w/ NG
tube to suction. By hospital day 3 the patient was having bowel
movements and with no abdominal pain.  She was started on a
regular diet which she tolearted well. The pt did not have
further nausea/abdominal pain. Although her amylase/lipase
trended up throughout the admission, she was not symptomatic so
it was decided to stop trending her enzymes. She was seen by GI
the day before discharge and it was decided that she should
follow up for an MRCP then with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3315**] for o/p work up of
the etiology of her pancreatitis.

4. Anemia - The patient was given several units of blood (total
6U) for low blood counts while she was in the ICU.  It was
thought that the etiology of her anemia was a combination of low
grade DIC (as her platelets also decreased, her DDimer was
elevated and her fibrinogen nadired at 250) and blood loss
during her U/S guided D+C. She was transferred to the floor on
[**9-14**] (HD 5) and from that point on her hematocrit was stable
between 25-28. She did not require any blood transfusions while
on the floor.

5. Thrombocytopenia- On admission, the patient's platelets were
44. The differential for her low platelets included DIC, HIT (pt
given lovenox) and HELLP. Her PTT/INR was 22.3/1.5,D-dimer 4514,
fibrinogen-258 which was suggestive of low grade DIC (although
if truly DIC picture would expect fibrinogen to be lower).  A
HIT antibody was sent which was negative. The timing and
clinical picture (9 wks s/p SVD and no labs suggestive of
hemolysis, no hypertension) was less consistent with HELLP
syndrome. Her platelets trended up throughout the admission. At
discharge, the patient's platelets were 480.

6. ARF - the patient's baseline creatine is 0.5 and at admission
was 1.2.  Initial urine lytes before hydration were consistent
w/ a pre-renal picture.  Subsequently, however, muddy brown
casts consistent with ATN were noted in the patient's urine.
Over the course of her ICU stay, the patients Cr trended
downward as she autodiuresed well. Her creatinine remained at
her baseline on her last three hospital days.

7. Hyperthyroidism-On admission, the patient was tachycardic
~130s (sinus). It was thought that the tachycardia was secondary
to volume depletion vs infection. Her HR ranged from 100-170s,
but trended in 100-120s with gentle hydration/antibiotics. On
the day of transfer to the floor, the patient remained in the
120s so other sources of sinus tachycardia, including thyroid
function, were evaluated. Her TSH was <0.02 and her free T4 was
elevated. She was started on low dose beta-blocker for control
of her heart rate. It was titrated up over a few days to
maintain a HR 60-80 with hopes that by controlling her HR it
would be less stressful to her heart and her cardiomyopathy
would resolve. Endocrine was consulted for the question of
hyperthyroid therapy and they felt that PTU or methmimazole
would not be necessary during this admission and rate control
would be sufficient. They also wanted to send several tests to
evaluate for thyroiditis, hashimotos, and [**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease (her
mother has had a thyroidectomy for [**Name (NI) 933**]). She will follow up
with Endocrine as an o/p for the results of these labs and
possible further treatment.

8. Elevated Blood Sugars-Throughout the admission, her fasting
fingersticks ranged from 100-170. In the setting of illness,
these numbers were not acted on but she was told to follow up
for a fasting glucose as an outpatient.

9. Retained Products of Conception-THE POC were removed on
[**2164-9-12**]. The patient had minimal vaginal bleeding after the
procedure. An intraop US showed no further retained POC. The
pathology from the DandC was consistent with necrotic villi. She
will follow up with her OB/GYN as o/p in 2 weeks.

10. Anisocoria-On the day of transfer to the floors, it was
noted that the patient's pupils were not equal R>L by more than
1 mm. (comparison of old pictures showed this was not previously
the case.) Over the next two days, it was also noted that she
developed ptosis of the right eyelid. She was seen by neurology,
who thought the presentation was consistent with Horners and
could be secondary to right IJ placement. An US of her neck was
done which was negative for carotid dissection, hematoma, mass.
At no point did the patient have other focal neurological
symptoms. It was thought that the anisicoria should resolve on
its own and the pt could follow up with neurology in the future
if it did not resolve.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium. A left atrial appendage
thrombus cannot be excluded. No atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area 0.5 cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a small left pleural effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in the
OR.

POST-BYPASS:
For the post-bypass study, the patient was receiving vasoactive
infusions including phenylephrine and was AV paced.

position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient
= 11 mmHg and cardiac output of 2.6 L/min). Trivial central
aortic regurgitation is seen.
2. Regional and global left ventricular systolic function are
normal.
3. Right ventricular systolic function post-bypass is moderately
hypokinetic.
4. The intra-atrial septum is dynamic.
5. Aortic contours are intact post-decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo male, initially admitted for SOB/CHF exacerbation;
hospital course discussed by problem.
# Dyspnea- he had been ruled out for a PE by CTA done in the ED.
 The patient appeared to fluid overloaded in likely CHF
exacerbation by exam and by CXR.  The patient was diuresed
effectively with IV Lasix.  He also had a troponin leak up to
.06, peak CK in 300's.  An echo was done which showed global
hypokinesis and an EF of 15%.  Cardiology was consulted, and the
patient underwent a P-MIBI, which revealed LV enlargement and a
mild, fixed defect of inferior wall.  Cardiac cath was discussed
with and subsequently performed on the patient, which
demonstrated no CAD, but severely depressed LVEF.  The patient's
ACE was increased, and a statin, low-dose beta-blocker, and
Lasix were initiated, with an improvement in his symptoms.
Given the patient's low EF, a EP consult was obtained for
possible ICD placement.  Prior to pacer/ICD placement, the
patient underwent a TEE to evaluate for possible atrial
thrombus, none was found.
.
On [**1-11**], the patient had a [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacemaker and ICD
placed, but EP studies on [**1-13**] showed that the RV lead was not
in the correct position. The patient had been started on
anticoagulation for Afib/flutter, so FFP was given to reverse
his INR in preparation for EP re-positioning of RV lead.
However, the patient became acutely SOB and hypertensive while
in EP lab. The patient was intubated and given 40 mg IV Lasix,
and nitroglycerin and the EP procedure was completed. He was
then transferred from to the CCU for CHF and ventilator
management.
.
While in the CCU, the patient the patient became tachy and
hypotensive, required dopamine for 24 hours to maintain
pressure.  Cardiac enzymes were repeated, and an echo was
repeated to rule out tamponade.  The patient improved with
aggressive diuresis, was successfully weaned off pressors and
extubated.  Although the patient had one temperature spike
during the CCU, no infectious source was found, and he received
48 hours of empiric antibiotics following the EP procedure.  The
patient was transferred back to the medicine floor and remained
hemodynamically stable and afebrile, with no further episodes of
chest pain or shortness of breath.
.
# CHB- his pacemaker was upgraded to dual chamber [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
pacer along with the ICD. He will be followed in the device
clinic, with his first appointment on [**2147-1-20**].
.
# h/o a-fib/aflutter- He was rate controlled with Lopressor,
titrated up to a dose of 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], given that his blood
pressure tolerates this.  He was also started on Coumadin,
initially mg, titrated down to 2.5 mg every evening.  INR
monitoring will be required on a daily basis to ensure correct
dosing for a target range of 2.0-3.0
.
# L upper extremity edema- Following his stay in the CCU, the
patient's LUE was noted to be edematous and an ultrasound was
obtained which confirmed a DVT.  The patient was already on
Coumadin, but a heparin drip was started as his INR at that time
was subtherapuetic.
.
# hypothyroidism- He was continued on his current dose of
Levoxyl, and thyroid studies were done which showed an elevated
TSH and low free T3, however no medication changes were made
during this acute exacerbation of CHF.
.
# Hypertension- The patient's blood pressure remained well
controlled following the procedure and his stay in the CCU.  A
number of new medications (beta blocker, Lasix, ACE increase)
were started to help optimize his cardiac health, however, these
may need to be tailored to prevent hypotension.  The patient was
ruled out for both tamponade and infection as potential causes
of hypotension.
.
# FEN- The patient was placed on fluid restriction of 1.5L per
day and tolerated a low sodium/cardiac diet well.  His
electrolytes were carefully monitored in the setting of
diuresis, with occasional K+/Mg repletion.
.
The patient was evaluated by physical therapy, who recommended
the patient be admitted to a rehab facility.  This was discussed
with both the patient and his family, including his HCP; and he
was subsequently discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for further
rehabilitation.  The patient will need follow-up with the
EP/device clinic as described above.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**7-14**]: Pt went to the OR as an elective admission for resection
of posterior fossa mass via suboccipital craniotomy. The patient
tolerated this procedure very well with no complications. Post
operatively she was transfered to the ICU for further care
including q1 neuro checks and strict SBP control to less than
140. Upon post op exam the patient remained at her neurological
baseline without defecit. Her incision was C/D/I with no active
drainage and her pain was well controlled. She remained in the
ICU overnight with no medical issues.

[**7-15**]: Pt was seen in A.M rounds and was doing well. No new
defecits and was AOx3. She underwent post operative head ct that
showed no acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. The patient
did require a nipride iv drip for blood pressure control and
this was effectively weaned in the evening with new blood
pressure requirements of less than 160. MRI head was consistent
with post operative changes and no acute pathology.

[**2034-7-15**]: Pt did well upon arrival to the floor but did develop
some mental status changes over the weekend and become more
agitated. She was somewhat disoriented in the evenings and a
geriatric medicine consult was called. They felt her changes
were likely due to her decadron and hospital stay. Some
medications changes were made and her decadron was tapered to
2mg twice daily.
  She did have some difficulty swallowing on the 25th and the
speech and swallow team saw her on the 26th. She was deemed
unsafe for PO intake on the 26th and was made NPO. A dobhoff
tube was attempted but the patient was uncooperative and she did
remove it on her own.

[**7-19**]: Speech and Swallow consulted patient and recommended NPO.

[**7-20**]: Patient was cleared for soft solids by Speech and Swallow.
Pt was cleared and discharged to rehab.

maternal fever, a fetal tachycardia. Membranes were ruptured
for clear fluid around 4 hours prior to delivery. The
delivery was by spontaneous vaginal delivery with a  loose
nuchal cord. The infant emerged vigorous with a good cry.
Apgar scores were 9 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. Around
1/2 hour of age he developed grunting that improved for a
short time and then reoccurred prompting this admission to
the Newborn Intensive Care Nursery.

continuous positive airway pressure, 5 cm requiring around
25% oxygen with decrease in his retracting and grunting.
Around 24 hours of age he was intubated for worsening
respiratory distress associated with a left sided pneumothorax.
This was treated with needle thoracentesis. The patient received
a total of 2 doses ofsurfactant for respiratory distress syndrome
and was extubated around 44 hours of age to a nasal cannula. He
weaned to room air on day of life 4 and has remained in room air
since with a comfortable work of breathing, respiratory rates in
the 30s to 50s.

CARDIOVASCULAR: He has been hemodynamically stable throughout
hospital stay. A murmur was noted on admission that was
resolved by day of life 3. At discharge there is no murmur.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 50388**] was admitted to the Crimson Colorectal Surgery
Service after transport from ED and was evaluated as a candidate
for colostomy and colectomy.  He was placed on telemetry, and
was kept NPO with intravenous administration of linezolid,
metronidazole, levofloxacin, and fluconazole.  On HD 2, he
underwent CT-guided placement of a pigtail catheter in his left
lower abdominal quadrant and drainage of 50 cc from the
recurrent iliopsoas abscess; cultures subsequently revealed
pseudomonas, coagulase negative staph aureus, and probable
enterococcus.  He was restarted on a regular diet on HD 3.  On
HD 5, the patient spiked a fever to 103.6, with tachycardia to
the 80's, occasional PVC's, and hypotension (SPB 100-120).  He
was immediately transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit;
subsequent blood culture grew enterococcus in 1 of 3 bottles.
Cardiology work-up on HD 6 revealed an evolving apical MI.  At
this time, the patient was deemed an inappropriate surgical
candidate and his surgery was cancelled.  He was transferred off
the SICU on HD 6 with continued drainage of fluid from his
pigtail catheter.  The drain was repositioned by IR on HD 8, and
upsized on HD 12 to expedite drainage.  The patient will be
discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation on HD 14 with a PICC line
for long-term IV antibiotic administration.

development of medical necrotizing enterocolitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby baby [**Name (NI) 4549**] is a [**2049**] gram
product of a 31 and 6/7 weeks twin gestation born to a 28-
year-old G3, P0, now 2 woman.

Prenatal screens - A positive, antibody negative, hepatitis
surface antigen negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive,
GBS unknown. This pregnancy is remarkable for in [**Last Name (un) 5153**]
fertilization, dichorionic, diamniotic twin complicated by
preterm labor cervical shortening at 24 weeks. The mother was
treated with bed rest and magnesium sulfate. Betamethasone
given on [**2148-6-10**]. She remained on bed rest that [**Doctor First Name **]-
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for one month and discharged
home on PO terbutaline. She presented on the night of the
delivery with spontaneous labor with spontaneous rupture of
membranes 37  minutes prior to delivery. Vertex, vertex
presentation, prompting cesarean section delivery. Per
parents' wished, did not want to try a labor. The infant
emerged initially with good tone and cry, however then
developed apnea, large amount of oropharyngeal secretions
that were suctioned. The baby required bag, mask ventilation
and further suctioning of orogastric fluid. Apgars were 5, 7,
and 8.

hypercholesteromia presents with being found unresponsive this
morning.  Patient was initially reported by [**Location (un) **] to have been
last seen well at 9pm last night.  However, upon speaking to son
on his arrival (initially not answering his cell as was driving
here), he was seen walking to get a glass of water this morning
between 5am and 7am.  However, later this morning he was found
in
the basement on the ground, unresponsive and non-verbal. EMS was
called and noted that he would open his eyes to verbal stimuli
and seemed to withdraw to painful stimuli.  There was no speech.

He appeared hot and diaphoretic.  SBP was 170/100 on the scene.
He was given Narcan with no response.  Patient was taken to

Brief Hospital Course:
61-year old man with known hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
recent arthroscopic knee surgery presents with being found
unresponsive with no verbal output and no spontaneous movement
on right, currently exam notable for not following any commands,
non-verbal, inattentive to right, with right facial droop and
hemiparesis.  Head CT from OSH shows possible left MCA
hyperdense sign and hypodensity in L MCA territory all
consistent with L MCA infarct.

inital CT scan demonstrated extensive left middle cerebral
artery distribution infarct, without evidence of hemorrhage at
this time. Complete occlusion of left internal carotid artery
along its entire course, from the carotid bifurcation to the
left MCA, with extensive clot burden. Near complete occlusion of
left M1 and M2 branches, reconstituted more peripherally. Very
minimal flow in the left M1 segment via the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
Atherosclerotic disease at the right carotid bifurcation, with
minimal stenosis.

Patient was admitted to the Neuro ICU as no step-down beds
available and patient will
need close monitoring for airway protection and possible
hemorrhagic conversion or edema of potentially large infarct.
Patient was kept on telemetry and stabalized.
-
A follow up head CT 2 days later showed.  Further evolution of
left MCA infarct, with slight increase in mass effect on the
anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle. No herniation.

Then the following day a CT demonstrated: Continued evolution of
a left middle cerebral artery territorial infarct.  Mild mass
effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle is
unchanged. No evidence of transtentorial herniation. No
hemorrhage detected.

MI was ruled out with negative cardiac enzymes.

Patient was started on Aspirin 325 mg PO daily.  On [**2114-7-11**]
patient was started on coumadin with an aspirin bridge.  Patient
was started on coumadin 5 mg PO daily. Goal [**1-31**]. Patient's PCP's
office was contact[**Name (NI) **].  [**Name2 (NI) **] should follow up with PCP for INR
monitoring after leaving rehab center.

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54 year old man
admitted to Intensive Care Unit on [**2151-1-31**], from [**Hospital3 6265**] for evaluation of hematemesis, melena and abdominal
mass.  The patient had been doing well until the Tuesday
prior to admission when he developed a headache at which
point he took Vicodin and developed nausea and vomiting and
abdominal pain.  On the Thursday evening prior to admission,
he states he passed out on the floor of the bathroom and had
a fall secondary to severe pain.  He states that he had loss
of consciousness for about fifteen minutes.  He denies head
trauma.

On the Saturday prior to admission, the patient states that
he had some retching with blood.  He presented to the
Emergency Department at [**Hospital3 3583**] where he was admitted
and found to have a hematocrit of 26.3, potassium 6.2, and he
was also in acute renal failure.  Abdominal CT indicated a
large peripancreatic mass.  The patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation.

On transfer, his white blood cell count was 28, and his
creatinine was 3.4.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  History of spontaneous pneumothorax.
2.  History of immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis.
3.  History of peptic ulcer disease, status post surgery.
4.  Acute renal failure.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Vicodin p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states he is allergic to Sulfa,
Aspirin and Naprosyn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works in sales.  He has a twenty
pack year history of smoking.  He denies alcohol or street
drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient's
temperature was 97.0, heart rate 107, respiratory rate 15,
blood pressure 135/42, oxygen saturation 98% on two liters.
In general, the patient was alert, in no acute distress.  The
neck was supple.  Pulmonary examination indicated scant
crackles bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination indicated
regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a II/VI systolic
murmur.  The abdomen was distended with decreased bowel
sounds and mild diffuse tenderness to percussion.  On
extremity examination, the patient had 2+ peripheral pulses
with no edema.  His stool was guaiac negative.

LABORATORY DATA:  Initial laboratory studies indicated a
white count 28.6, hematocrit 25.6, platelet count 404,000.
Chem7 indicated a blood urea nitrogen 43 and a creatinine of
3.4.  INR was elevated at 1.9.  Liver function tests were
within normal limits.

Electrocardiogram indicated normal sinus rhythm, rate 99
beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals and no
ischemic changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit.  Nasogastric lavage was performed which indicated
the presence of coffee ground emesis.  He was evaluated by
the gastroenterology service and emergent endoscopy was
performed which indicated the presence of a hiatal hernia as
well as compression of the second and third part of the
duodenum. A biopsy was taken at the compression site which
indicated chronic inactive duodenitis and focal Brunner gland
hyperplasia.  There was also gastric mucocele metaplasia.

CT of the abdomen indicated a 10 by 6.0 centimeter soft
tissue mass within the mesentery just below the pelvic rim as
well as a 10 by 16 centimeter mesenteric and retroperitoneal
hematoma displaying the duodenum anteriorly and compressing
the inferior vena cava.  Significant mesenteric
lymphadenopathy was also noted.

Renal and surgery services were consulted.  On the
recommendation of the surgery service, a follow-up abdominal
CT with p.o. contrast was completed which indicated
persistent intra-abdominal hematoma but no intra-abdominal
mass.  The patient was also now noted to have increased liver
function tests with an ALT of 622, AST of 649, and normal
total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.

As the patient's hematocrit continued to drop, a bleeding
scan was conducted which indicated active bleeding into the
abdomen with no clear source.  The patient therefore received
an angiogram which indicated the presence of a superior
mesenteric artery aneurysm as well as active bleeding from
the gastroduodenal artery which was embolized.

The patient also developed shortness of breath following the
administration of a total of fourteen units of packed red
blood cells in the Intensive Care Unit.  Chest x-ray
indicated the presence of congestive heart failure and a
possible left sided infiltrate.  The patient was started on
Lasix as well as Levaquin and Flagyl.  A hepatitis panel was
sent which was negative.  ANCA was sent out of concern over
possible polyarteritis nodosa, however, this study was
negative.  The patient was also started on total parenteral
nutrition secondary to an expected ileus following
embolization.

While in the Intensive Care Unit following embolization, his
transaminases trended downward, and his creatinine improved,
and his hematocrit remained stable.  The patient did develop
transient episodic hypertension to a systolic pressure of 200
requiring Labetalol drip, however, this was successfully
weaned and the patient was transitioned to Labetalol tablets.
While in the unit, he also developed bipedal and scrotal
edema, which again was thought secondary to volume overload
in the setting of multiple transfusions.

Echocardiogram conducted on hospital day number four
indicated ejection fraction of greater than 55% with 1+
tricuspid regurgitation.

On hospital day number six, the patient was transferred to
the floor for additional workup of questionable abdominal
mass.  On repeat [**Location (un) 1131**] of the patient's existing CAT scans,
it was determined that what was initially read as a mass on
the first CT was likely to be extension of the hematoma.
Follow-up imaging in four weeks was recommended.

On his first day on the floor, the patient spiked a
temperature to 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit.  Repeat chest x-ray
indicated worsening pulmonary infiltrates bilaterally. At
this point, the patient was switched to Ceftazidime and
Clindamycin to treat possible nosocomial pneumonia.  Sputum
and blood cultures were sent which were negative.

The patient's pulmonary status improved significantly on
intravenous antibiotics.  As the patient was able to tolerate
p.o. intake, his total parenteral nutrition was discontinued.
However, the patient noted some pain with eating and was
found to have a small lesion at the site of his denture
insertion site.  The patient was able to tolerate food after
pretreatment with Viscous Lidocaine solution.

Although the patient's initial abdominal pain subsided, he
was maintained on Oxycontin for control of residual abdominal
pain while on the floor.  The patient's lower extremity edema
decreased with the administration of intravenous and then
subsequently p.o. Lasix.

On hospital day number ten, the patient was noted to have
increasing jaundice and altered mental status.  Liver
function tests at that time indicated an alkaline phosphatase
of 1091 and total bilirubin of 11.4.  His transaminases were
only slightly elevated.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound
was performed which indicated a dilatation of the common bile
duct as well as the presence of biliary sludge.  There was no
intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation and no gallstones.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed
after consultation with the gastroenterology service.  This
study indicated a fifteen millimeter common bile duct which
was stented as well as stenosis of the distal bulb.  The
patient's liver function tests, jaundice and mental status
improved following endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography.  The patient was to have a
follow-up endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in
three months for stent removal.

Although the patient's mental status did improve following
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, some residual
symptoms of agitation and paranoia prompted a psychiatry
consultation who recommended low dose of Haldol p.r.n. for
worsening of these symptoms.  However, the patient's mental
status slowly returned to his baseline.

The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service who
found that he would benefit from acute rehabilitation.  At
the time of this discharge summary, the patient was being
screened for placement in an acute rehabilitation facility.

COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
severe
single vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary
artery
had no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses.  The
LAD had
mild luminal irregularities.  The LCX was a non-dominant vessel
without
lesions.  The RCA was a dominant vessel with a 99% stenosis in
the mid
vessel with evidence of thrombus.
2.  Resting hemodynamics were performed.  Right sided pressures
were
severely elevated (mean RA pressure was 18 mm Hg).  Pulmonary
artery
pressures were moderately elevated (PA pressure was 50/29 mm
Hg).  Left
sided filling pressures were markedly elevated (mean PCW
pressure was 29
mm Hg).  Central arterial pressures were moderately elevated
(aortic
pressure was 161/104 mm Hg).  Cardiac index was normal (at 3.2
L/min/m2).
3.  Successful PCI of the RCA with two overlapping Cypher DES
(3.5 x 8
mm and 3.0 x 23 mm).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severely elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
3. Successful Primary PCI of the RCA with two drug-eluting

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 40 year old male with a history of heavy
tobacco use, family history of CAD who presented with inferior
MI s/p RCA stent x 2

1. CAD
- The patient had a Cypher stent placed to the right coronary
artery with no further events. He had a few isolated episodes of
NSVT post-cath attributed to reperfusion.
- The patient was continued on aspirin and must take Plavix for
the next 9 months. He was placed on a statin with close
monitoring of his LFTS which were slightly elevated on
presentation given his history of EtOH use. He was titrated up
to Toprol XL 50 mg and Lisinopril 5 mg.

2. HTN
- The patient originally felt a little dizzy and lightheaded
with Lopressor 25 mg TID with systolic blood pressures in the
90s. Therefore, he was changed to Toprol XL 50 mg without
difficulty. He was also titrated to Lisinopril 5 mg.

3. CHF
- The patient had a PAWP of 31 in the cath lab. His CXR showed
no evidence of CHF. He was given lasix 20 IV x 2 total and
auto-diuresed on his own, remaining euvolemic throughout the
rest of his stay.
- He had an echocardiogram which showed an EF of 55-60% with
hypokinesis of the inferior wall. An echocardiogram should be
repeated in 4 weeks post-MI to re-evaluate any residual wall
motion abnormality.

4. Smoking cessation
- The patient was encouraged to quit smoking. He has tried the
nicotine patch and gum in the past without success. We discussed
the possibility of wellbutrin, however, given his alcohol
consumption, we felt it may be a risk in lowering his seizure
threshold. The patient was encouraged to join group tobacco
cessation therapy but he appeared hesitant. He will try to quit
tobacco on his own but admits there is temptation given that
most of the people he lives with at home smoke.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname 24524**] is a 64-year-old
male who had a history of progressive exertional dyspnea
after quitting smoking approximately six months ago.  Workup
for this exertional dyspnea included an exercise treadmill
test that was ultimately positive for ischemic changes as
well as an echocardiogram and subsequently an elective
cardiac catheterization.  Cardiac catheterization completed
on [**2140-12-5**] showed left main coronary artery disease with
modest calcification and distal 50% taper.  The left anterior
descending also had moderate calcification with a proximal
70% lesion after D1 and R1.  The D2 moderate vessel was 90%
proximal tubular lesions, D1 and R1 had ectatic proximal
vessel and a large distal vessel.  The left circumflex artery
was nondominant vessel with a proximal 90% lesion with
moderate calcification as well.  The right coronary artery
was the dominant vessel, with a total proximal occlusion and
bridging with left-right collaterals.  The posterior
descending artery was known to be a good target.  Additional
findings on the catheterization were abdominal aorta with a
large infrarenal aneurysm beginning 13 mm below the renals,
bilaterally single without disease.  The largest extent of
the aneurysm was 4.8 cm with a length of over 11.7 cm.
Proximal runoffs reveals moderate ostial left iliac lesion.
The common femoral artery and the superficial femoral artery
are bilaterally normal.

Given the patient's significant three vessel coronary artery
disease and symptoms of occasional angina and dyspnea on
exertion, it was determined that he would be an appropriate
candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting.  The
Cardiothoracic Surgery service was consulted after the
catheterization procedure, and the following history was
obtained.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   History of inferior myocardial
infarction by electrocardiogram, mild chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, 6 cm
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm as noted previously that
was picked up incidentally on examination by his cardiologist
several months ago, benign prostatic hypertrophy, gout,
greater than 75 pack year smoking history but he recently
quit in the last six months.  He is hypothyroid.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once
daily, Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once daily, atenolol 50 mg by
mouth once daily, allopurinol 100 mg by mouth once daily,
Flomax .4 mg by mouth once daily, Tapazole 20 mg by mouth
once daily, and Mavik 1 mg by mouth once daily.

LABORATORY DATA:   Preoperative hematocrit was 36.  BUN and
creatinine were 17 and 1.1.  Catheterization data as stated.
Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.  His
electrocardiogram was significant for sinus bradycardia at
54, with Q waves in II, III and AVF.  He had no abnormal ST/T
wave changes.  He had early J-point elevation.  He did have
early R wave progression as well.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Heart rate 54, blood pressure 134/70,
no acute distress, no chest pain, no carotid bruits
auscultated.  The heart was regular, with a prominent S2, no
murmur.  The lungs were clear to auscultation except
decreased breath sounds throughout.  His abdominal
examination was soft, nontender, nondistended.  There was a
pulsatile mass palpated between the xiphoid and umbilicus,
approximately 5 cm by examination.  There was no
hepatosplenomegaly, there was no renal bruit.  Flank
examination was negative.  His lower extremities had palpable
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses distally
bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Given this presentation, it was elected to
bring him to the operating room on [**2140-12-8**].  He was first
discharged after his elective catheterization on [**2140-12-5**] and
ultimately readmitted on [**2140-12-8**], where he underwent an
elective coronary artery bypass graft x 4 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
including a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending, a right saphenous vein graft to the diagonal, as
well as a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal and
saphenous vein graft to the right posterior descending
artery.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Intraoperative findings of transesophageal echocardiogram
were an ejection fraction of 45 to 50%, calcified aorta, good
distal targets.  His pericardium was left open.  He had a
right radial A-line.  He had a right internal jugular cordis
in place, CVP, right atrial catheter.  He had two ventricular
wires and two atrial wires, and two mediastinal tubes and one
pleural tube.  His mean arterial pressure was 77, with a
right atrial pressure of 9.  He was found to be in normal
sinus rhythm at a rate of 74.  He was on a propofol drip of
20 mcg/kg/minute for sedation.

He was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Recovery Unit,
where in the first 24 hours after surgery, all of his drips
were weaned off and he was rapidly extubated.  He remained in
sinus rhythm at 88, with blood pressures in the 120s to 130s.
His hematocrit was 25 postoperatively, with a BUN and
creatinine of 18 and 1.  Neurologically, he remained intact.
He was started on his lasix, Lopressor, aspirin.  Chest tubes
were removed, as well as diet advanced.

He was subsequently transferred to the floor by postoperative
day number one.  He was up and ambulating on postoperative
day number one, feeling well.  He worked with Physical
Therapy aggressively, and continued pulmonary toilet with
incentive spirometry, coughing and deep breathing.  His
electrolytes were repleted as needed.

By postoperative day number two, he continued to feel well.
He had a low-grade temperature of 100.9, but otherwise the
remainder of his vitals were normal, with a heart rate of 94
and sinus, blood pressure of 114/60.  His Lopressor was
titrated accordingly.  He had  BUN and creatinine of 23 and
1.0, and a hematocrit of 24.

By postoperative day number four, the patient was ambulating.
His wires, chest tubes and Foley had been removed at this
point.  He was in sinus tachycardia to sinus rhythm, between
90 and 103.  His blood pressure was ranging 106 to 110 over
50s to 60s. Oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.  He had a
stable sternum, with no evidence of drainage.  His abdominal
examination was unchanged from admission.  His extremities
were warm and well perfused, with palpable pulses at dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibial bilaterally.

Subsequently the patient was deemed stable and appropriate
for discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   Lopressor 75 mg by mouth twice a
day, Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once daily, lasix 20 mg by mouth
once daily for seven days, K-Dur 20 mEq by mouth once daily
for seven days, Protonix 40 mg by mouth once daily, aspirin
325 mg by mouth once daily, allopurinol 100 mg by mouth once
daily, Tapazole 20 mg by mouth once daily, Flomax .4 mg by
mouth once daily, percocet 5/325 one to two tablets by mouth
every four to six hours as needed, and Colace 100 mg by mouth
twice a day.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with VNA.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Stable, afebrile, in normal sinus
rhythm, no evidence of sternal drainage.

DISPOSITION:   To home with VNA with instructions not to
undergo any heavy lifting greater than ten pounds for 30
days, no driving for 30 days.  Wound may get wet with shower.
He will have follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in four weeks, follow
up with his cardiologist or primary care physician in three
weeks from the time of discharge.  VNA will assist the
patient.  If they happen to dismiss him after day seven
through ten, he can return to the Wound Care Clinic, where he
will receive a wound checkup.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Significant three vessel coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass graft x 4, with left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein
graft to diagonal, obtuse marginal and also right posterior
descending artery.

History of Present Illness:
80 yo female with pmh of DM and htn who was admitted with CP on
[**12-25**]. The day prior to admisssion she had substernal CP,
diaphroesis which occured for a few minutes. The next morning
she had a repeat episode also with HA (which she has when her BP
increases with anxiety. In the ED her BP was 232/95 upon
presentation. She stated she had taken her BP meds. She was
given lopressor. Head CT was negative. Her HA improved. Her EKG
showed NSR in the 90s with no ST segment changes, however her
Trop was 1.8. She was started on a nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and
given ASA.
.
She was taken to cath today where she complained of chest pain.
She became acutely anxious and agitated. Her SBP increased to
the 240's with her LVEDP in the 30's even when given TNG 200
mcg/min IVD, furosemide 20 mg IV, 6 mg total of morphine,
midazolam IV, labetalol IV bolus, nitroprusside IV infusion, and
amlodipine 10 mg po. As the procdure continued she began
complaining of SOB and worsening chest pain so the procedure was
stopped. Her renal arteries where not visualized
angiographically. Her SBP eventually fell to the 150s.
.
Here she is confused and only occasionally will answer
questions. She does admit to continued chest pain, but denies
shortness of breath.

1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
2 vessel obstructive coronary artery disease. There were dual
ostia
giving rise to the LD and LCX. The LAD had a tubular 65%
stenosis in the
proximal portion just before D1. The distal LAD wrapped around
the apex.
The LCX had a 95% subtotal occlusion in the AV groove segment
immediately after OM1, which was a tortuous vessel. The [**Month/Day (2) 11641**]
had a hazy
proximal 70% stenosis followed by a mid 75% stenosis. The RCA
tapered in
the proximal to mid portion suggestive of moederated disease
with
diffuse plaquing througout. There was a large very tortuous AM
and RPL.
2. Limited resting hemodyanmics demonstrated severe systemic
systolic
arterial hypertension with a SBP >200mm Hg. There was evidence
of
diastolic heart failure with an elevated LVEDP of 23. There was
no
transaortic valvular gradient on careful pullback of the
catheter from
the left ventricle to the aorta.
3. The patient became progressively uncomfortable, dysnpneic and

agitated during the procedure, which was terminatned. Renal
angiography
was planned but not attempted.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Multivessel coronary artery disease involving LAD, [**Month/Day (2) 11641**], AV
groove
CX, with diffuse disease in the RCA.
2. Mild to moderate LV diastolic heart failure.
3. Severe systemic arterial hypertension.

[**12-27**] C Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography showed 2-vessel coronary
artery
disease.  The LAD had a proximal tubular 70% stenosis.  The LCx
had a
high OM1 with proximal and mid 60-70% stenoses.  There was a 90%

stenosis in the distal AV groove LCx that was of small caliber.
The RCA
was not injected.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic
arterial
systolic hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 175/75
mmHg.
3. Successful direct stenting was performed in the proximal LAD
using a
3.0x23mm Vision bare-metal stent.  This was post-dilated using a
3.0mm
NC [**Male First Name (un) **] balloon.  Interim angiography showed normal flow, no
apparent
dissection, and no residual stenosis.
4. Successful PTCA was performed in the distal LCx using a
2.0x15mm
Voyager balloon.  Final angiography showed normal flow, no
apparent
dissection, and a 40% residual stenosis.
5. The right femoral arteriotomy was successfully closed using a
Mynx
device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
3. Placement of a bare-metal stent in the proximal LAD.
4. PTCA of the distal LCx.

[**12-27**] Echo
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Diastolic function could
not be assessed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-12-4**],
the degree of mitral regurgitation has increased. Diastolic
function cannot be determined on the current study. The other
findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo female with pmh of htn and DM admitted with an [**Hospital 7792**]
transferred to the CCU after an attempted cath due to a
hypertensive emergency secondary to anxiety and agitation.

She was taken to cath on [**12-25**] where she complained of chest
pain.  She became acutely anxious and agitated.  Her SBP
increased to the 240's with her LVEDP in the 30's even when
given TNG 200 mcg/min IVD, furosemide 20 mg IV, 6 mg total of
morphine, midazolam IV, labetalol IV bolus, nitroprusside IV
infusion, and amlodipine 10 mg po. As the procdure continued she
began complaining of SOB and worsening chest pain so the
procedure was stopped.  Her SBP eventually fell to the 150s when
she was transferred to the CCU on a nitrogylcerin and
nitroprusside drip.

The two drips were weaned off overnight.  Her CP resolved as her
anxiety and agitation decreased.  The heparin gtt was held given
her recently elevated SBP due to the risk of hemorrahage.  She
had elevated BS in the 430's which remained elevated after 6
units of humalog x2, so she was started on an insulin gtt until
the morning when she was weaned off and given 4 units of lantus
and covered with SSI.  She was delirious overnight and was given
5 mg of zyprexa x2 and 2.5 mg iv haldol x1 for agitation and
required restraints to avoid her from climbing out of bed and
pulling out her IVs.

The cath from [**12-25**] showed multivessel CAD involving the LAD,
[**Last Name (LF) 11641**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] grrovve Cx, and diffuse disease of the RCA.  The
option of CAGB was discussed, however given her age and how
poorly she tolerated the cath, it was decided to take her back
to cath again and place a stent in the major lesion.  She was
taken to cath on [**12-26**] where she had a bm stent placed to the LAD
and POBA to the distal LCx.  Her SBP rose to the 200's during
the procedure again and she was started on a nitro gtt which was
weaned off overnight as her blood pressue was better controlled
with oral medications.

Problem Based Hospital Course:

# s/p NSTEMI:  The patient had no prior history of CAD, but had
positive Cardiac enzymes in the setting of hypertensive
emergency.  On cath, she was found to have multivessel CAD
involving the LAD, [**Month/Day (2) 11641**], AV groove Cx, and diffuse disease in
the RCA, however the major occlusion was a 95% subtotal
occlusion of the AV groove Cx. She underwent a second cath [**12-27**]
as the first was terminated due to agitation and hypertension.
She had a bare metal stent placed to the LAD and PTCA to the
distal LCx.

Service: Newurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57 year old
female with no past medical history who had sudden onset of
midback pain and severe headache.  She said it felt like a
bomb while giving a speech in [**Country 2784**].  She finished her
speech and vomited once.  This was on [**2139-9-4**].  The headache
persisted.  She returned to the United States the following
day with increased fatigue, headache and backache.  She went
to [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department on [**2139-9-7**], where a
CTA revealed a large bilobed 1.2 to 2.0 centimeter ACA
aneurysm, was transferred to [**Hospital 4415**] on
[**2139-9-7**], for further workup.  CTA was repeated confirming
the previously mentioned aneurysm.  She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for embolization of the
aneurysm.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  ETOH and was a thirty pack year smoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Neurologically she was completely
intact.  Speech was clear.  The pupils were reactive to light
and accommodation, 3.0 millimeters and brisk.  No facial
asymmetry.  No drift.  Speech was clear and fluent, awake,
alert and oriented times three.  Vital signs revealed blood
pressure 92 to 106 over 60 to 70s, respiratory rate 14 to 18.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and went directly
to the angiography suite where she had her bilobed ACA
aneurysm coiled.  The coiling was only partially done at that
time.  During the actual angiogram and coiling, the patient
did complain of chest pain.  She was seen by cardiology in
the angiography suite and the chest pain resolved on its own.
It was felt to be anxiety produced.  Postoperatively, vital
signs are temperature 96.0, blood pressure 103/60, pulse 69,
respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 99%.  The patient was
awake, alert and oriented times three.  She was unsure of
which hospital but was recently transferred.  She did know
the month and not the day.  Negative drift, symmetric smile.
The pupils were equal and reactive times light and
accommodation, 2.5 to 2.0.  She did have some left
conjunctival hematoma.  Positive pedal pulse.  Groin was
intact with sheath.  Her upper and lower extremities revealed
motor strength was [**3-23**].  She followed commands.  She had no
headache.  Her white blood cell count was 9.4, hematocrit
32.9.  Her preoperative hematocrit was 37.7.  Her prothrombin
time was 15.4, partial thromboplastin time 150.  INR was 1.6.

On the first postoperative day, the patient's vital signs
were in the 99 to 100 range.  She was awake and alert and
oriented times three.  She complained of seven out of ten
headache, no diplopia.  Extraocular movements were full.
Visual fields were intact.  Negative drift.  Grip was [**3-23**].
Positive femoral right pulse.  She remained in the neurologic
Intensive Care Unit where she received Nimodipine 30 mg
q2hours, normal saline at 150 per hour.  Central line was
placed.  Her blood pressure was kept less than 140.  Heparin
was continued at 600 per hour.  On [**2139-9-9**], the patient was
brought back to complete her coiling.  Postoperatively, she
was awake, alert and oriented times three.  Her speech was
fluent.  Naming was intact.  She followed commands.  Her
right groin sheath remained intact.  Her blood pressure was
kept in the 100 to 130 range.  She needed to remain on
Heparin as the apparent vessel was possibly thrombosed and we
did not want to wean her off.  Heparin was kept at 600 per
hour.  We did not want the area to thrombose quickly.  Her
coiling went well and was successful.  She remained on
Heparin postoperatively.  The patient remained in the
Intensive Care Unit on Heparin and her partial thromboplastin
time was kept between 60 to 80.   The sheaths remained in
place.  On [**2139-9-14**], the patient was awake, alert and
oriented with no complaints and grips were [**3-23**], no drift.
The patient's Heparin drip was reduced on [**2139-9-14**], and she
was started on Aspirin 325 mg once daily.  However, the
patient did start to complain of blurry vision with
peripheral type tunneling of the left eye lasting thirty to
forty-five minutes.  A retinal fellow was consulted where she
was found not to have any evidence of vascular occlusion.
She did have some decreased vision in the left eye, however,
the patient claimed it was lasting greater than 1.5 years.
It was felt to be an ocular migraine in her left eye.  The
patient did continue to stay on Heparin.  On [**2139-9-15**], her
partial thromboplastin time was at 50.  She was seen by the
retinal specialist who still felt that it was an ocular
migraine and they did sign off and wanted to follow-up as an
outpatient.  Heparin was stopped on [**2139-9-16**].  Aspirin 81 mg
was continued.  Her sodium was 136, and had dropped to 134.
Those were monitored twice a day.  On [**2139-9-16**], the patient
underwent a cerebral angiogram to check the progressive
thrombus of the coiled left internal carotid artery.  Stable
appearance of the coils were noted on that day.  She was to
start on Plavix at 75 mg once daily and Aspirin 325 mg once
daily.  She no longer needed Heparin.  Postoperative check,
she was awake, alert.  Extraocular movements were full, no
drift.  On [**2139-9-18**], she remained awake and alert with no
headaches at this time.  Extraocular movements were full.
Her face was symmetric.  Her sodium was 134.  Again, her
angiogram the previous day showed no spasm.  Intravenous
fluids were kept at 150 per hour.  She did continue on the
Nimodipine.  On [**2139-9-18**], we did ask the retinal specialist
to reexamine the patient as she complained of decreased
vision in her left eye for the last one to two days.  Her
ophthalmic examination was within normal limits.  Her
decreased acuity to her left eye was unclear.  Possibilities
included mass effect, compression of the aneurysm.  They
recommended considering intravenous steroids, also
recommended getting an ESR, CRP and then a neurologic
ophthalmology consultation.  Neurophthalmology did seen the
patient and felt that there was some compression of optic
neuropathy but they felt that it was related to her ACA
aneurysm and mass effect.  They did request some steroids.
The patient was started on Decadron 4 mg p.o. q6hours.  On
[**2139-9-19**], her vision was improved.  On [**2139-9-21**], the patient
underwent status post neuroform stent mediated coiling of her
right internal carotid artery aneurysm.  Postoperatively, she
did well with no intraoperative complications.
Postoperatively, she was to stay on Plavix and Aspirin.  Her
sheaths remained in place overnight and she remained on
Heparin overnight.  Postoperatively, she was alert without
complaints, denied headaches or double vision.  Her left
groin was oozing around the sheath.  Dressing was replaced.
The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements were full.  Visual
fields were full to confrontation.  They recommended one unit
of packed red blood cells.  Her blood pressure was kept in
the 120 range and continued on Aspirin and Plavix.
Postoperatively, her hematocrit was 28.5 and on [**2139-9-22**], she
did receive one unit of packed red blood cells.  Sheath was
removed.  On [**2139-9-23**], her vital signs were temperature 98.2,
blood pressure 97/49.  White blood cell count was 10.0,
hematocrit was now 32.1, platelet count 364,000.  The patient
was neurologically intact.  There was no sign of hematomas.
On [**2139-9-24**], the patient was transferred out of the
Neurologic Intensive Care Unit.  She was given a physical
therapy consultation.  Her intravenous fluids were decreased
to 100 per hour.  Her diet was increased as tolerated.  She
was given intravenous boluses for her systolic blood pressure
less than 100.  She remained on the surgical floor.  The
patient was discharged on [**2139-9-26**].

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  No strenuous exercise, no driving until cleared by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1132**].
2.  She is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in one week and

IMPRESSION:  Patient is a 31-year-old male with history of
heroin abuse presenting to the Emergency Department for detox
with fever to 104.0 F, abdominal pain, increased white count
with left shift, possible Osler nodes on exam.  Admitted with
likely endocarditis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Patient's blood cultures grew
staphylococcus aureus which was Methicillin sensitive after
incubation for one day in four out of four bottles.  CT Scan
of the abdomen showed multiple small wedge shaped perfusion
defects within the kidneys bilaterally as well as multiple
wedge shape and triangular low attenuation areas in the
spleen consistent with septic emboli.  Transthoracic
ultrasound showed aortic insufficiency 1 to 2+, no definite
evidence of vegetation.  A transesophageal echocardiogram was
performed which showed a vegetation on the aortic valve with
no definite evidence of perivalvular evidence.

The patient was initially started on Vancomycin, Oxicillin
and Gentamycin for synergy for treatment of endocarditis.
After the culture and sensitivity came back, the Vancomycin
was discontinued. The Gentamycin was continued for synergy
which was then discontinued four days into the hospital stay
and continued on IV Oxicillin.  [**Known firstname 17766**] continued to spike
fevers despite the continued antibiotics and an EKG daily
showed some prolongation of the PR interval, however did not
show actual prolongation beyond 200 milliseconds.

Due to the spiking fevers, a TEE was performed once again on
[**2115-12-27**] this time showing evidence of a
perivalvular abscess as well as a fistulous track between the
right ventricle and the aorta.  The patient was also noted to
have no worsening of the aortic insufficiency.

Further work up prior to replacing the aortic valve, it was
felt the patient would benefit from reevaluation of all
possible septic emboli and a MRI was done once again of the
head which showed several septic emboli as per the MRI on
admission with no definite evidence of mycotic aneurysms,
however prior to undergoing surgery it was felt to be a
benefit to undergo a better study in order to better evaluate
for mycotic aneurysms and the patient underwent a four vessel
cerebral angiogram which showed no evidence of mycotic
aneurysms.

As the patient also had poor dentition, it was felt that it
would improve his outcome if his teeth were removed.  Dental
and Oral Surgery consults were obtained and the patient's 18
teeth were removed under general anesthesia.  He tolerated
the procedure well with no complications and is not having
pain at this time from the actual procedure.

Repeat imaging of the abdomen for evaluation of the septic
emboli to the spleen and the kidneys revealed a splenic
septic embolus which was unclear in characteristics if it was
actually representing an abscess and this was further
evaluated with an abdominal ultrasound which did not show any
clear evidence of fluid within the mass of the spleen and
likely represented an infarcted portion of the spleen.
Surgical Service was consulted for possible drainage of this
collection and did not feel like this would be warranted
given the appearance on ultrasound.

While an inpatient, the patient was also tested for HIV,
hepatitis C and hepatitis B the results of which were
hepatitis B was negative, HIV was negative.  Hepatitis C
showed evidence of antibody, however PCR for RNA is still
pending at the time of this discharge, but will need to be
followed as an outpatient.

2.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  Sodium was noted to
be significantly low on admission which improved somewhat
with hydration and there was likely a prerenal component to
the hyponatremia, however after adequate p.o. intake and
hydration, the sodium did not significantly improve and it
was noted that the Oxicillin was being given in D5 water
which was then changed to normal saline and had a significant
improvement in the electrolyte balance with a sodium in the
133 to 135 range.  In comparison with the urine osmos and
urine sodium and creatinine did show some element of SIDH as
well.

3.  PSYCH / ADDICTIONS:  Patient is currently on Methadone
maintenance for heroin withdraw and his tolerated his
Methadone with very little craving or withdraw symptoms.  He
was initially started on large dose of Methadone which was
gradually tapered down to 30 mg p.o. q. day.  Patient is
interested in decreasing this even further as an outpatient.

4.  HEMATOLOGY:  Patient's hematocrit was noted to be
approximately 37 on admission which declined significantly
during his hospital stay down a hematocrit of 23 to 24 at its
lowest.  Iron studies as well as B12, folate and hemolysis
labs were all sent which showed evidence of iron deficiency
anemia likely also with overlying anemia of chronic disease.
There might have been some element as well as of hemolysis
due to the sheering of force in the aortic valve.  Was
started on iron and also transfused one unit prior to being
transferred to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service.  Stool
guaiacs were negative with the exception of one stool guaiac
which showed trace guaiac positivity.  Likely as the
infection subsides and with the replacement of iron, the
patient's hematocrit will improve.

This is the end of the dictation for the Medicine portion of
this dictation summary.  The rest of the course will be
dictated by Cardiothoracic Surgery.

[**10-14**] Tagged RBC Scan -  Moderately brisk intermittent bleeding
originating from the ascending colon.

[**10-28**] CT - ?cortical infarct or pyelonephritis, small simple
left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on [**10-13**] from OSH with lower GI bleed since
patient was a Jehovah's witness and continued to have bloody
bowel movements. Patient was admitted to the medical ICU and
underwent a tagged RBC scan which suggested that the bleeding
eminated from the ascending colon. Angiography was then
performed which did not visualize the source of bleeding. The
patient continued to have BRBPR and the general surgery service
was consulted. Upon consultation the patient was found to have a
hematocrit of 13.7 and an emergent colectomy was offered to
resolve the active bleeding.

The patient refused blood products citing her religious
perference and all the patient was aware of all risks of the
procedure and consented. The patient went to the OR on [**10-14**] and
underwent a right hemicolectomy with ileocolostomy. The
procedure was without complications and the patient was
transfered to the TSICU in critical condition. Patient remained
on the ventilator for several days, and was started on
erythropoetin and IV Iron to maximize her RBC production
capability. She was started on parenteral nutritional prior to
return of bowel function.  She was successfully extubated on
pod# 10 and transfered to the floor once her hematocrit
stabilized. Once the patient was transferred to the floor her
hematocrit slowly increased each day and upon discharge was 23.

GI Bleed - The patient continued to have guiac positive stool
while in the ICU however these were felt to be the result of
retained blood in the colon. After the patient was transferred
to the floor patient had no episodes of BRBPR and no evidence of
GI bleeding.

Heme - Upon discharge the patients hematocrit was 23.9 which was
significantly higher than her post op Hct of 8. The patient was
started on 20K Units of EPO and will continue therapy for 1 week
as well as Iron supplementation for 1 month.

Pulm - Post operatively the patient developed a left lower lobe
pneumonia which was treated with a one week course of cipro.
Upon discharge the patient was afrebrile with a normal WBC.

GI - The patient was started on parenteral nutrition while in
the unit however was advanced to a regular diet after admission
to the floor. Patient was discharged able to tolerate a regular
diet.

CV - Patient continued to be tachycardic throughout her hospital
course as a result of her anemia. She was also hypertensive on
several occassions which was treated with IV then PO Lopressor.
Upon discharge the patient remained tachycardic and continued to
have episodic hypertension which we will have her PCP follow up
on.

GU - While in the ICU the patient developed an enterococcal
urinary tract infection which was treated appropriately with
antibiotics

Dispo - Patient will be discharged to short term rehab and will
follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**] in approximately 1-2 weeks

Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo female with atrial fibrillation, severe hypertension and
diastolic heart failure. Initial plan was for TEE/cardioversion.
 A TEE was performed which did not show any clot. She initially
had an attempted DC cardioversion X 3 however these attempts did
not bring her into sinus.  She was initiated on sotalol with
good rate control established with HRs < 100 however she
remained in sinus rhythm.  She was continued on coumadin for
anticoagulation.  She was hypertensive and hypokalemic and a
work-up for hypertension was initiated; renal artery ultrasound
pending.  Valsartan was increased from 80 to 160 daily for
improved BP control; spirinolactone was discontinued.  Labetalol
was discontinued given initiation of sotalol. Plasma
renin/angiotensin were ordered but were pending.   Given
symptomatic improvement and rate control, she was transferred to
the floor for further management.  She was evaluated for [**Doctor Last Name **] of
hearts monitor on discharge; follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] is
scheduled. She also has an appointment with her PCP scheduled on

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms [**Known lastname 85533**],

You were admitted because your heart rate was too fast in the
rhythm that we can ""atrial fibrillation"" and also had high blood
pressure.  We tried to convert you from this rhythm using
electrical shock, however this did not keep you in a normal
rhythm for long.  For this reason, we started you on a new
medication while in the hospital to help control your heart
rates.  We also made some other medication changes to help
control your blood pressure.  These changes in medication are
scheduled below.  You will need to follow up with your
cardiologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] as an outpatient, who may try additional
therapies to try to convert you out of atrial fibrillation.
.
The medication changes we made during this hospitalization are:
(1) Started warfarin, a blood thinning medication, which you
should take every day.  You need to take 3 mg daily.  This is
important medicine because it prevents your heart from forming
blood clots while you are in atrial fibrillation.  You will need
to see the [**Hospital3 **] on [**Hospital3 766**] morning to get labs
checked for this medicine.  Instructions on attending this
clinic are listed below.
(2) Started Diovan HCT 160 - 12.5 mg which is a medicine to help
lower blood pressure.
(3) Started sotalol 120 mg twice a day.  This medicine helps
prevent your heart rate from going too fast.
(4) Started amlodipine 10 mg daily - another medicine to help
control your blood pressure.
(5) Started spirinolactone 25 mg daily for your blood pressure.
(6) Stop your benicar-HCTZ combination pill.
(7) Stop labetolol.
(8) You should go to the [**Hospital3 **] at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
on [**Location (un) 766**] [**6-10**] to get your INR (coumadin level) checked.
The [**Hospital3 271**] will call you on [**Hospital3 766**] morning to
confirm this.

Followup Instructions:
Primary Care: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **]

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4643**] was transferred from OSH after cardiac cath revealed
left main and multi-vessel disease. As well as echo showing 3+
mitral regurgitation. Upon admission he was appropriately
medically managed and worked-up for surgery. On [**10-10**] he was
brought to the operating room where he underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 4 and mitral valve repair. Please see
operative report for surgical detail. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive management in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one his
chest tubes were removed. All drips were weaned off on post-op
day one and on post-op day two he was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further care. Beta blockers and diuretics
were initiated and he was gently diuresed towards his pre-op
weight. On post-op day three his epicardial pacing wires were
removed. The remainder of his postoperative course was
essentially uneventful. He was transfused a total of 2 units
PRBCs postoperatively for anemia. He continued to progress and
on POD#5 was discharged to home with VNA. He was instructed on
all necessary follow up appointments.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction who was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for percutaneous angioplasty after a
seven minute episode of ventricular tachycardia without
intervention.  The patient was found in the bed by his wife,
choking and unresponsive in the mid afternoon on the day of
admission.  The wife called her daughter who in turn
activated the Emergency Medical System.  The patient was
found in V fibrillation and was treated with epinephrine,
atropine and Dopamine.  He was then taken to [**Hospital 35774**] Hospital
where he was given Lidocaine and Amiodarone.
Electrocardiogram was notable for ST depressions in V4 and 5
and 6 leads with junctional rhythm.  He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for emergent cardiac
catheterization.  Cardiac catheterization was notable for
mild to moderate left anterior descending coronary artery
stenosis and stenting of first diagonal was performed.  He
was then transferred to the floor sedated and intubated.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, which is
life long, coronary artery disease, questionable myocardial
infarction in [**2108**], percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty [**2116-6-14**], left anterior descending coronary
artery 95% stenosis, OMI 90% stenosis, obtuse marginal one
stent and diabetes apparently diet controlled.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease.
The patient's father died at age 57 of an acute myocardial
infarction.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has an 80 pack year history of
smoking until [**2115**].  No ethanol.  He is an engineer and
married with children.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Zocor 40 once a day, Plendil 5
once a day, atenolol 25 once a day and Vaseretic dose
unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.8.  Heart rate 66.
Blood pressure 124/61.  The patient was intubated on AC at
600 tidal volume 14 respirations with an FIO2 of 40% PEEP 5.
On physical examination intubated, sedated, spontaneous
monoclonic jerks.  HEENT pupils small, minimally reactive to
light.  No gag reflex.  Cardiovascular regular rate and
rhythm.  No murmurs.  Pulmonary clear to auscultation
anteriorly.  Abdomen nondistended, soft.  Extremities
positive pulses in all four extremities.  The patient has
paroxysmal monoclinic jerks.  Neurological examination eyes
open spontaneously.  No tracking.  No roving eye movements.
No response to verbal or painful stimuli.  Cranial nerves
examination pupils 2 mm no light reaction appreciated except
for possible minimal change in left pupil.  No corneal reflex
bilaterally.  Does not blink to light bilaterally.  Slide
both eye movements, but no response to ________ testing.  No
gag obtainable.  Motor increased tone throughout with normal
bulk and intermittent myoclonic movements of all four
extremities that increase in frequency when the patient is
stimulated.  No drawer, no flexor or extensor response to
pain.  The patient does not protect face when arm drop
towards it.  Reflexes has 3+ brachial radialis biceps and
triceps reflexes, both left and right arms.  3+ triceps
reflexes bilaterally, 2+ patella reflexes bilaterally and 4+
ankle reflexes bilaterally.  No plantar movements.  The
patient has positive [**Doctor Last Name **] sign bilaterally in upper
extremities three to four beats of clonus at both ankles.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 10.0, hematocrit 41.5,
platelets 165, sodium 145, K 3.3, chloride 105, bicarb 19,
BUN 20, creatinine 1.6, glucose 237.  Arterial blood gas pH
7.3, PCO2 46, PO2 292, calcium 8.4, total bilirubin 0.4, CPK
44, alkaline phosphatase 83, troponin less then 0.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Immediately upon admission a neurological
consult was obtained and indicated wide spread severe anoxic
brain damage.  CT scan of the head was done and showed a
small subcortical hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe
multiple lacunar infarcts, which were chronic and reduced
great white matter of visibility consistent with global
ischemic change.  Given the patient's history he was started
on Amiodarone to prevent further arrhythmias.  He was also
hypertensive and was started on Lopressor, aspirin, Plavix,
statin, Captopril.  Since admission the patient started
spiking low grade fevers and was started on Flagyl and
Levofloxacin for empiric treatment of possible infection.

Since the beginning of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay there were
multiple meetings with the patient's family were undertaken
by the primary care team and neurology team in attempt to
explain the poor prognosis, which according to neurology
given the patient's status 93% no improvement and 7% slight
improvement with severe neurologic damage, 0% moderate to
complete improvement of the patient's neurological status.
The patient's family voiced their understanding of the
current situation and decided to proceed with tracheostomy
and PEG tube placement and maintain the patient full code.

On [**7-23**] a tracheostomy tube was performed at the bedside
by interventional pulmonology without complications.  PEG
tube placement was performed by GI on [**7-27**].  The patient
was extubated on [**7-28**] in the early a.m. and remained
stable over the next 24 hours on flow by oxygen at 35%.  His
cardiovascular status remained stable with high normal blood
pressures and cardiac rhythm significant for intermittent
atrial fibrillation with spontaneous conversion to sinus
bradycardia without requiring any intervention.  Infectious
disease wise he remained afebrile since the initiation of
antibiotic treatment.  His neurological status remained
unchanged.  The patient was in a vegetative state at the time
of discharge.

The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital
Naddick for long term care and management with a diagnosis of
acute myocardial infarction status post ventricular
fibrillation and anoxic brain injury.  His discharge
medications were insulin sliding scale per flow sheet,
calcium gluconate 500 po t.i.d., Lansoprazole oral solution
30 mg nasogastric q.d., heparin 5000 units subQ q 12, aspirin
325 mg po q day, Metoprolol 75 mg nasogastric b.i.d. being
held for a systolic blood pressure less then 100 or a heart
rate less then 60, Captopril 75 mg po t.i.d. to be held for
systolic blood pressures less then 90.  Saliva substitute 1
to 3 milliliters po q 1 to 2 hours prn, Metronidazole 500 mg
intravenous q 8 last dose [**8-1**].  Acetaminophen 325/650
po q 4 to 6 hours prn for fever or pain, Levofloxacin 500 mg

Respiratory failure due to cardiomyopathy: Intubated prior to
her C-section with general anesthesia.  Found to have bilateral
pleural effusions; TTE  showed an of EF 45% and new MR/TR. This
is indicative of peripartum cardiomyopathy.  Optimal treatment
with neurohormonal blockade was initiated with beta blockers and
ACE inhibitors.  She was able to tolerate lisinopril 40mg daily
and labetalol 600mg po tid.  She was diuresed with IV lasix
(20mg IV bid) and upon discharge she was transitioned to 20mg po
daily.  She was euvolemic upon discharge.  On the day prior to
discharge she underwent a repeat echocardiogram, EF was 50% and
there was 1+ MR.  She was advised to avoid further pregnancy at
least until her ejection fraction returns to normal.  She was
set up for follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 449**] Change from the Advanced
Heart Failure Clinic at [**Hospital1 18**].

Severe Preeclampsia:  With hypertension and significant
proteinuria. Treated with stat C section and 24 hours of
magnesium drip. She was followed by maternal fetal medicine
throughout her hospitalization.

Thyrotoxicosis: likely [**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease with exopthalmos, tremor,
tachycardia, cardiomyopathy.  She was started on methimazole
which was titrated down to 20mg po daily.  The patient will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**9-25**].

Post-op Cesarian delivery: Stable with average post-op bleeding
and vaginal bleeding.  She was given rectal misoprostol to help
stop her bleeding.  Her Hct remained stable. Her baby girl was
admitted to the NICU upon delivery and was doing well at the
time of her mother's discharge.

Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 68 year old white male had
an abnormal stress test in 02/[**2194**].  He underwent cardiac
cath which revealed 100 percent RCA lesion.  He had angina
again in [**2196**] and had an abnormal stress test and was re-
cathed, and that showed 100 percent RCA lesion, a 50 percent
left main stenosis, and a left circumflex stenosis.  He had
no symptoms and surgery was deferred.  He now has had a month
of angina again and had an abnormal treadmill with an EF down
to 27 percent.  An angio on [**2198-1-31**] revealed a 95 percent
ostia left main, a 70 percent diagonal 2 lesion, 80 percent
OM and 100 percent RCA lesion with a normal LV.  So he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His past medical history is
significant for a history of non-insulin dependent diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, prostate CA, and status
post removal of a basal cell carcinoma from his back two
weeks prior to admission.  He is also status post cataract
surgery.

MEDICATIONS:  His medications on admission were nitroglycerin
drip, Metformin, Lipitor, aspirin, multivitamin, Metamucil,
Atenolol.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is significant for coronary
artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He does not smoke cigarettes and drinks
alcohol occasionally.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  His review of systems is as above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a well developed, well nourished
white male in no apparent distress.  Vital signs stable.
Afebrile.  HEENT  exam normocephalic and atraumatic.
Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx benign.  Neck
was supple.  Full range of motion.  No lymphadenopathy or
thyromegaly.  Carotids 2 plus and equal bilaterally without
bruits.  Lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion.
Cardiovascular exam regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and
S2 with no rubs, murmurs or gallops.  Abdomen was soft and
nontender with positive bowel sounds.  No masses or
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities without cyanosis, clubbing
or edema.  Pulses were 2 plus and equal bilaterally
throughout.  Neuro exam was nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted and on [**2198-2-2**]
the patient underwent a CABG times five with a free LIMA to
the LAD and reverse saphenous vein graft to the diagonal,
OM1, OM2 and PVA.  Cross clamp time was 89 minutes.  Total
bypass time was 125 minutes.  He was transferred to the CSRU
on Neo in stable condition.  He had a stable postop night.
He was extubated.  On postoperative day one he was started on
a beta blocker and his nitro was weaned.  Postop day two he
was transferred to the floor in stable condition and his
chest tubes were discontinued.  Postop day three his
epicardial pacing wires were discontinued.  Postop day number
four he began having sternal drainage.  He was started on
Kefzol and had his wounds painted with Betadine tid.  He did
have some more drainage and his lower two sternal wires
seemed to have pulled through on his x-ray, so on postop day
number five he underwent sternal re-wiring.  He tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred back to the floor.  He
continued to improve and had his chest tubes discontinued on
postop day number one from re-wiring.  He was also changed to
Levofloxacin and Vanco.  He continued to improve but
continued to have intermittent sternal drainage.  He had
cultures which were negative.  He had a PICC line placed and
was continued on Vanco.  Eventually his drainage stopped
completely and he had two days of no drainage and his Vanco
was discontinued and he was discharged to home on a week of
Levofloxacin.  So on postop day number 17 he was discharged
to home in stable condition.

Date of Birth:  [**2169-8-3**]        Sex:  F

Service:  NB

IDENTIFICATION: [**Known lastname 63410**] [**Known lastname 63411**] is a 7 day old former 40 [**5-4**] wk
infant with meconium aspiration syndrome and neonatal depression
who is being discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**] NICU.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname 63410**] [**Known lastname 63411**] was born on [**2169-8-3**] as
the 2.74 kg product of a 40 and [**5-4**] week gestation pregnancy
to a 37 year-old, G4, P1 now 2 woman.  Prenatal screens:
Blood type B positive, antibody negative, Rubella immune, RPR
nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, HIV
negative, group Beta strep status negative.  The pregnancy
was notable for normal fetal survey and amniocentesis with
karyotype 46XX.  On the day of delivery, the mother presented
with decreased fetal movements.  Fetal heart rate monitoring
showed a non-reassuring pattern with decreased variability and
late decelerations, and the mother was taken for urgent Cesarean
section delivery. At delivery, meconium stained amniotic
fluid and nuchal cord were noted.  The infant emerged limp
with poor tone and absent respiratory effort.  She was
intubated with meconium suctioned from below the cords.
Subsequent resuscitation included vigorous stimulation and
positive pressure ventilation for approximately 1 minute,
with gradual improvement in color, tone and onset of
respiratory effort.  Apgars were 3 at 1 minute, 7 at 5
minutes and 8 at 10 minutes.  Cord blood pH was 6.95.

Due to persistent work of breathing and oxygen requirement, the
infant was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT ADMISSION:  Wt 2740 gm (10-25%)  HC 34.5
cm (50-75%).  BP 59/38 (51).  O2sats in 70s-80s on 100% blow-by
oxygen.  Well developed infant in moderate respiratory distress,
stunned appearing with decreased responsiveness and open eyes.
Fontanelles soft and flat.  Palate intact. Red reflex present
bilaterally. Neck supple.  Chest coarse, poorly aerated, with
moderate grunting, flaring, and retractions.  Cardiac regular
rate and rhythm without audible murmur.  Abdomen soft, no
hepatomegaly, 3-vessel cord that is thin and meconium stained.
Normal female genitalia, anus patent.  Tone grossly normal,
activity decreased, no clonus.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY
DATA:

System #1, Respiratory:  Secondary to significant hypoxia, [**Known lastname 63410**]
was placed on continuous positive airway pressure shortly after
admission to the NICU with 100% oxygen.  Initial oxygen
saturations revealed pre-ductal saturations in mid-80s with
post-ductal saturations in mid-70s, consistent with persistent
pulmonary hypertension.  CXR revealed diffuse increased
interstitial markings consistent with aspiration, as well as a
small right pneumothorax.  Initial blood gas had a pH of 7.06
witha PC02 of 52, and pO2 of 55.  Oxygen saturations gradually
improved to mid- to high-90s, and subsequent blood gas revealed
pH 7.22, pCO2 41, and pO2 68.   She initially received normal
saline boluses in presence of pulmonary hypertension and
metabolic acidosis, and subsequently received sodium bicarbonate.


Her respiratory status steadily improved.   The pneumothorax
resolved over the first 24 hours of life.   She was able to
transition to nasal cannula 02 on the second day of life and by
day of life 3, had weaned to room air.  At the time of discharge,
she is breathing comfortably in room air with a respiratory rate
of 30 to 60 breaths per minute.

System #2, Cardiovascular:  As described above, [**Known lastname 63410**]'s initial
course was consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  She received
two normal saline boluses, and remained hemodynamically stable
throughout.   No murmurs have been noted.  Baseline heart rate is
120 to 160 beats per minute with a recent blood pressure of 65/54
with a mean of 57.

System #3, Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  [**Known lastname 63410**] was
initially n.p.o. and treated with intravenous fluids.  She
had umbilical, arterial and venous catheters placed.  Initial
blood glucose was 13. She required multiple boluses of
dextrose and eventual continuous infusion of 15% dextrose with
normalization of her blood glucose level.  Enteral feeds were
started on day of life 3 and gradually advanced. She was able to
wean off the glucose infusions by day of life number 5.  Serum
electrolytes were within normal limits throughout.  At the time
of discharge, she is breast feeding ad lib.  Discharge weight is
2.895 kg with a corresponding head circumference of 34 cm and
a length of 47.5 cm.

System #4, Infectious disease:  [**Known lastname 63410**] was evaluated for
sepsis upon admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
White blood cell count was 33,800 with a differential of 39%
polymorphonuclear cells, 2% band neutrophils.  A blood
culture was obtained prior to starting intravenous Ampicillin
and Gentamycin.  Blood culture was no growth at 48 hours.
[**Known lastname 63410**] did receive a 7 day course of antibiotics for presumed
sepsis and possible meconium pneumonitis. Gentamycin levels
were within normal limits.  A lumbar puncture was performed and
was reassuring without evidence of meningitis.

System #5, Hematologic:  Hematocrit at birth was 57%. Initial
platelet count was 72,000.  This was followed daily through
day of life 3 when her platelet count fell to 36,000.  She
received a platelet transfusion with a post transfusion count
of 176,000.  Subsequent platelet counts initially decreased but
then remained stable, with values of 111, 96, 105, and 96.  Most
recent platelet count on the day of discharge is 96,000.
Coagulation studies revealed normal PT, PTT, and fibrinogen, with
mildly elevated D-dimers.  Maternal blood was sent for platelet
antibody screen; HLA-antibodies were present, but no
platelet-specific antibodies were detected.  The HLA-antibodies
are not thought to contribute to alloimmune thromobocytopenia.
Overall the thrombocytopenia is most likely secondary to mild
neonatal depression.

[**Known lastname 63410**] is blood type B+ and is Coombs negative.

System #6, Gastrointestinal:  Liver function tests were sent
on day of life number 1 and were mildly elevated.  The
repeated values on day of life 4 showed a gradual decline.
Peak serum bilirubin occurred on day of life 4, total of 12.4
over 0.6 mg/dl.  She was not treated with phototherapy.

System #7, Neurology:  Perinatal course was consistent with mild
neoantal depression. A head computed tomography scan was
performed on [**2169-8-6**] with results within normal limits, without
evidence of hemorrhage.  She was evaluated by the
neurology service from [**Hospital3 1810**], and was thought to
have an improving exam with mild hypertonia.  Follow-up with the
neonatal neurology program 1 month after discharge was arranged.
At the time of discharge, her neurological examination is
reassuring with normal tone and reflexes.

System #8, Sensory/Audiology:  Hearing screening was
performed with automated auditory brain stem responses.
[**Known lastname 63410**] passed in both ears.

System #9, Psychosocial:  This family is from [**Country 63412**] with
plans to return there at the end of [**Month (only) 216**].  Parents have been
very involved with [**Known lastname 63410**] and her care during admission.  The
[**Hospital1 69**] social work department
was involved with this family.  The contact social worker is
[**Name (NI) 36130**] [**Doctor Last Name 56162**] and she can be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8717**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Home with the parents.

Service:  MICU

HOSPITAL SUMMARY:  The patient was initially admitted to the
hospital on [**2186-2-7**] for hypothermia, hypotension, and
sepsis protocol.  The patient was brought to the hospital by
her son because she had had a slurring of her speech which
had resolved by the time she arrived at the hospital.

In the hospital the patient was fluid resuscitated initially,
and her blood pressure improved.  However, she became
hypotensive again and required intermittent pressors for
blood pressure support.  The patient had an echocardiogram
which revealed severe pulmonary hypertension with RV
dysfunction.  In the setting of fluid resuscitation, she
developed bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient had a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis on
[**2186-2-8**] which was complicated by a pneumothorax requiring
a right anterior chest tube.  She had a bronchoscopy which
showed a large amount of mucus plugs.  She was diuresed under
the guidance of a Swan Ganz catheter, and she underwent a
trial of vasodilators with nitric oxide and Viagra for
pulmonary hypertension.  However, she did not respond, and
she was felt not to be a candidate for ............ therapy.


She was extubated on [**2186-2-10**], transferred out of the
Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2186-2-11**] in stable
condition.  She was on the floor until [**2186-2-13**] when she
was found to be hypoxic, hypotensive, and tachycardiac.
Chest x-ray was done at that time which showed left lung
collapse secondary to mucus plugging.

The patient initially on hospital admission was ""Do Not
Resuscitate""/""Do Not Intubate,"" but her family had reversed
her code status.  At the time of worsening medical
deterioration on [**2186-2-13**], discussions were held with the
family about her code status and whether or not they would
want her to be rebronched, and the patient and the family
decided on [**2186-2-14**] that they did not want any further
intervention, so the patient was not bronched.

The hypotension at that time responded to fluid boluses.
However, on [**2186-2-14**] at 9 p.m. the patient became
unresponsive, her heart rate decreased to the 40s, and she
had no blood pressure.  The patient had fixed and dilated
pupils, no breath sounds, no pulse, no heart sounds.  Time of
death was 8:54 p.m.  Her sons were notified.

SERVICE:  Neonatology

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby boy [**Known lastname 59275**], twin number
one, delivered at 36 2/7 weeks gestation with a birth weight
of 2,400 grams and was admitted to the Newborn Intensive Care
Nursery from the Newborn Nursery at around 17 hours of age
for management of hypothermia and poor feeding.

The infant was born to a 42-year-old gravida I, para 0 now 2
mother.  Prenatal screens included blood type A positive,
antibody screen negative, hepatitis B surface antigen
negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, and group B
Streptococcus unknown.  The pregnancy was complicated by
diamniotic/dichorionic twin gestation.  Twin number one was
in breech position.  Twin number two was transverse.  The
mother presented with preterm premature ruptured membranes of
twin number one on the day of delivery.  No maternal fever.
Membranes were ruptured about seven hours prior to delivery.
The delivery was by cesarean section due to the infant's
positions of breech and transverse.  This infant emerged with
a good cry, received some free-flow oxygen.  Apgar scores
were eight at one minute and nine at five minutes.

In the Newborn Nursery, this infant required heat lamps for
hyperthermia and was not interested in feeding thus prompting
the admission to the Intensive Care Nursery.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The physical examination on admission
revealed a weight of 2,400 grams (25th to 50th percentile),
length 43.5 cm (15th to 25th percentile), head circumference
33 cm (50th percentile).  On examination, the patient was a
sleepy, pink premature infant in no respiratory distress.
The anterior fontanelle was soft, open, flat.  Red reflex
present in both eyes, palate intact, poor suck.  The lungs
were clear to auscultation and equal, regular rate and rhythm
without murmur.  There were 2 plus femoral pulses.  The
abdomen was soft, flat, with bowel sounds, normal male
genitalia with testes descended bilaterally, patent anus, no
sacral anomalies, hips stable, extremities pink and well
perfuse.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  RESPIRATORY:  No respiratory issues during
this hospitalization.  No apnea or bradycardia of
prematurity.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  Has been hemodynamically stable throughout
the hospital stay.  No murmur.

CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS TIME:104 minutes. CROSS-CLAMP TIME:93
minutes. Please see operative report for further surgical
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU
intubated and sedated in critical but stable condition. Later
this day he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically
intact and extubated without incident. He weaned from pressor
support and beta blocker/Statin/Aspirin and diuresis was
initiated. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed
per protocol. POD#1 he was transferred to the step-down unit for
further monitoring. Physical Therapy was consulted for
evaluation of strength and mobility. During his postoperative
course he developed atrial fibrillation and was treated with
beta blockers and amiodarone. Anticoagulation was initiated with
Coumadin. He developed a phlebitis from IV Amio and was placed
on a course of Keflex x 7 days. This was slowly improving. His
pulmonary status waxed and waned with a strong productive cough
and wheezing, which improved by the time of discharge. He
continued nebulizer treatments. CXR showed small bilateral
pleural effusions with atelectasis, no infiltrate or density.
His pulmonary status slowly improved by his day of discharge. On
POD 4 he developed a tender erythematous right knee and was
treated with colchicine for presumed gout. This had improved by
the time of discharge and the colchicine was discontinued.  On
POD 6 he was afebrile, ambulating with assistance, tolerating a
full po diet and his wounds were healing well. On POD 6 he was
discharged to Lifecare Center of [**Location 15289**] in stable

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Not able to obtain.

VITAL SIGNS ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 95.0, blood pressure
109/43 with a MAP of 65, heart rate is 97, and oxygen
saturation of 99%.  He was mechanically ventilated on SIMV
plus pressure support of 600 cc tidal volume with a
respiratory rate of 12 and a FIO2 of 1.0.  No spontaneous
respirations, PEEP of 5, and pressure support of 10.  He was
on dopamine at 21 mcg/kg/minute.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general he was unresponsive and
intubated.  Pupils were fixed and dilated.  There is no
response to confrontation.  Jugular venous pressure was not
seen.  The chest was clear anteriorly.  Heart has a normal
S1, S2 without murmur, and is regular, rate, and rhythm.
Abdomen was obese with a G tube in place with no surrounding
erythema or pus.  He is guaiac positive according to the exam
in the Emergency Room.  Extremities were without edema and
were warm.  Distal pulses were not felt in the feet, but
there were 1+ radial pulses.  Skin was intact without rash.
There is no response to voice, and he did withdraw to pain.
Toes were upgoing bilaterally.  Tone was increased with
flaccid tone noted on the left and decreased but flaccid on
the right.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES:  Hematocrit was 20.5, white count
7.0, platelets 182.  INR is 1.3.  Sodium is 139, potassium
4.4, chloride 103, bicarb 13, BUN 62, creatinine 1.1, and
glucose of 609.  Anion gap was 23.  Transaminases were
normal.  Amylase and lipase 103 and 22.  CK was 44 with a
troponin of 0.3.  Albumin 1.9.  Calcium 7.1, phosphate 6.3,
magnesium 2.2.

Arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.13, pCO2 of 40, and a pO2
of 252.  Lactate was 5.7.

Chest x-ray showed ET tube 7 cm above the carina with heart
size within normal limits and low lung volumes.  There is
normal pulmonary vasculature and a widen mediastinum.

CT angiogram of the chest showed a right lower lobe
aspiration pneumonia.  No pulmonary embolism.  A right lower
lobe mass 3.2 x 2.9 cm encasing the right lower lobe bronchus
and pulmonary artery.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy including
pericarinal and AP window lymphadenopathy.  An anterior 8 mm
nodule and ascites with intraabdominal hemorrhage.

Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 127 beats per
minute with ST depressions 1 mm in leads V3 to V6 with T-wave
inversions in those leads.  There was also T-wave inversions
seen in leads I, aVL, II, III, and aVF.

CT scan of the abdomen showed a layering hematoma adjacent to
the liver extending down the right pericolic gutter.  A 5.1 x
4.8 cm exophytic simple cyst in the right kidney in the lower
pole, a large 8.8 x 12 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm just above the bifurcation concerning for recent
expansion and no obvious liver disease or injury.

CT scan of the head showed a large chronic right middle
cerebral artery territory infarct that was felt to be old as
well as right cerebral watershed infarct also felt to be old.
There is also an old left caudate lacune.  There was no new
mass effect or intracranial hemorrhage.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 86-year-old male with advanced
dementia, abdominal aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease,
who presented with pulseless electrical activity, cardiac
arrest, and was successfully resuscitated, but now with
examination suggestive of anoxic brain injury.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The cause of the patient's PEA arrest was
not clear.  It was felt to most likely be multifactorial
secondary to anemia, pneumonia, and hypovolemia.  PE and
tamponade were effectively ruled out on CT angiogram.  The
patient's troponin rose to over 50, which was felt to be
consistent with the patient's cardiac arrest.  There is no
intervention that was felt to be required according to the
Cardiology consult service.

In terms of the patient's abdominal aneurysm, there was
radiographic evidence of recent expansion, but rupture was
ruled out by the abdominal CT scan.  Patient received packed
red blood cells for a hematocrit less than 28.  Blood sugar
was managed with insulin drip initially and changed to
regular insulin-sliding scale.  The patient's new lung mass
was not known prior to this admission and this was felt to
worsen the patient's overall prognosis.  This was
communicated to the family, who understood.

It was felt that the appearance of the mass was most
consistent with malignancy.  In terms of the patient's
pneumonia, he was given Levaquin and Flagyl.  The Neurology
Service was consulted and agreed to the Intensive Care Unit's
assessment that the patient had a very poor prognosis given
his multiple comorbidities and the prolonged arrest.

On [**2-8**], the patient developed new anisocoria and
repeat CT scan of the head revealed massive left sided edema
with subfalcial herniation and probable uncal herniation.
Mannitol was given as per the Neurology and Neurosurgery
consultants.  Vancomycin was added to the patient's
antibiotic regimen once blood cultures returned positive for
gram-positive cocci.

On [**2-9**], the family meeting was held with patient's
wife, son, daughter, and several of the physicians.  The
grave prognosis was communicated to the family.  The family
decided to withdraw the ventilator which was done.  Morphine
was given and titrated for comfort.

The patient died that night at 11:35 pm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old man with a
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with
complaints of increasing cough, dyspnea and decreased intakes
starting approximately three days prior to admission.  Per
his wife, he had a temperature of 100?????? in the morning and
shaking chills, cough productive of copious yellow sputum.
At baseline, has cough productive of white sputum.  He is
homebound and has had significant decline in his respiratory
status over the past three months.  He becomes quite dyspneic
on even minimal ambulation.  He uses 2 liters of oxygen at
home, has a 60 pack year history of smoking and quit in [**2187**].
He reports that the severity of his chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease waxes and wanes and that he does not feel
worse the day of admission than during his chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations.  He reports a
history of multiple chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
examinations at other hospitals, but that he has never been
intubated before.  In the Emergency Room, he was given 125 mg
of intravenous Solu-Medrol and levofloxacin.  In the
Emergency Department, he had an electrocardiogram that
initially showed sinus tachycardia, but then appeared to be
atrial fibrillation in the 170s.  He was given a Diltiazem
bolus and started on a Diltiazem drip.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, occasionally on po
steroids
2.  PFTs revealing an FEV1 and FVC ratio of 80%, FEV1 52% of
predicted asbestosis
3.  Hypercholesterolemia
4.  Head and neck cancer status post surgery and XRT in [**2178**]
5.  Anxiety
6.  Pneumovax in '[**86**]
7.  Flu vaccine
8.  Rheumatic fever as a child.  No known cardiac
echocardiogram prior to admission.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Serevent 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **]
2.  Azmacort 2 puffs qd
3.  Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers
4.  Librium 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] prn anxiety
5.  Tylenol #3 prn neck and rib pain

ALLERGIES:  ERYTHROMYCIN

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with wife in [**Location (un) 538**], 60 pack
year history of smoking, quit in '[**87**], former merchant marine,
question of asbestosis exposure and history of toxic DM
exposure, working as an antique furniture finisher.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
GENERAL:  Very cachectic elderly man breathing through pursed
lips on admission.
VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 175, blood pressure 116/74, respiratory
rate 40, 98% saturation on nonrebreather.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Edentulous.  Oropharynx dry.
CHEST:  Breathing with accessory muscles.  Breath sounds very
distant, scattered crackles posteriorly.
HEART:  Tachycardic heart sounds are very distant, unable to
assess if sinus or not.  Unable to assess murmurs.
ABDOMEN:  Thin, soft, nontender, nondistended, active bowel
sounds.  Stool is guaiac negative.
EXTREMITIES:  Thin, no edema.

ADMISSION LABS AND IMAGING:  Notable for a white count of
13.1 with 77% segs, hematocrit of 41.5.  Chemistries
unremarkable.  C was 79, troponin less than 0.3.  Urinalysis
was negative.  Arterial blood gases was 7.38, 46, 76 on 2
liters of oxygen and repeat was 7.38, 47, 50 on 1.5 liters of
oxygen.  Chest x-ray showed emphysema, pleural plaques,
diffuse perihilar and right apical opacities which were
consistent with an acute pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and taken to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  In the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, he was not intubated.  He received antibiotics,
levofloxacin for the pneumonia.  He received steroids which
were tapered, chest physical therapy and nebulizers with some
improvement.  His heart rate was controlled with Lopressor
and Diltiazem which were able to be switched to po and
cardiology felt he should be treated for his pulmonary
process before aggressive treatment for the atrial
fibrillation was started.  The patient and family decided on
comfort measures and he was transferred to the floor.  On the
floor, he remained stable with occasional runs of
tachycardia, seemed to be related to albuterol nebulizers.
He was able to tolerate nasal cannula oxygen and on [**2192-4-16**],
his rate had gotten up to 172 but it decreased to the 120s
after receiving 50 mg of intravenous Diltiazem.  Repeat
electrocardiogram showed that he was in atrial flutter and he
was continued on po Lopressor and Diltiazem.  His Lopressor
dose was increased to 75 mg po bid.  Palliative care consult
was called and they suggested switching him to sublingual
morphine sulfate elixir, as well as adding Ativan prn and
Colace and Senokot.

Pertinent Results:
CT Abdomen (Wet-Read) [**2123-4-26**]
1. Increased size of pelvic collection, Image 2:61, with
multiple tiny pockets of extraluminal air. The collection shows
early signs of organizing to an abscess.
2. Worsening of bowel wall thickening, consistent with Crohn's
flare.
CT Abdomen [**2123-4-28**] (wet read)
Marked interval increase in intraperitoneal fluid tracking
through the
mesentery, around the liver, and collecting in the pelvis. Large
pre-sacral pelvic collection has increased in size and
demonstrates increased rim enhancement, concerning for
developing abscess. Hyperemic mesentery and omental inflammatory
changes, likely worsened since the prior study. Focal collection
previously identified in the mid-pelvis appears largely
unchanged. Redemonstration of bowel wall abnormalities c/w
Crohn's flare, largely stable.

.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] 5 she was made NPO with
IVF/Foley/IVMeds/ABX. She was febrile to 102.9 with increased
pain. Her pain medication  was changed from morphine to dilaudid
with good effect. The patient also had a repeat CT scan showing
a fluid collection in her abdomen. She was taken to IR to have a
drain place. Scant thick pus aspirated and cultured.
.
A PICC line was placed and the patient was started on TPN with
bowel rest. She continued to spike temps to 103.0. Multiple
fever workups were done including BCX, UCX and CXR all negative
for infection. She had multiple CT scans done indicating
abcesses. She was taken to IR for Drain placement, 2 drains
placed for a total of 4 drains.
.
Despite the drain placements the patient continued to spike
temps to 104.6 on HD 19 requiring a cooling blanket. She was
than pre-op'd and taken to the OR for ex-lap, washout and drain
placement.
.
She returned to the floor. She was maintained as NPO, TPN was
continued along with a PCA, IVF, ABX. Infectious disease was
also consulted to recommend treatment. POD 1 the patient was
afebrile. However she continued to spike daily fevers there on
out. ID continued to follow the patient adjust antibiotics as
needed.
.
The patient c/o of severe pain and the pain service was
consulted. She was started on a fentynal patch and PO dilaudid
with good effect. At discharge the patient no longer needed the
fentynal patch, her pain was well controlled with dilaudid. Her
TPN was cycled and with the return of bowel function and flatus
her diet was advanced from sips to regular. Her TPN was d/c'd
once she tolerated regular diet.
All of her drains were d/c'd prior to d/c. The patient was
encouraged to have ensure with all meals. All D/C paperwork was
reviewed with the patient and all questions answered. She will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] in [**11-20**] weeks.

[**2200-2-24**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographycally apparent coronary artery disease. The LAD was
non-obstructed. The D1 had an ostial 80% lesion. The LCx had a
subtotally occluded in-stent restenosis in the mid stent at the
ostium
of the vessel. The RCA was small caliber, with a 70% lesion
proximally.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left sided filling
pressures
with LVEDP of 20 mmHg. There was normal  systemic arterial
systolic and
diastolic pressure with SBP of 109 mmHg and DBP of 72 mmHg.
3. There was a peak to peak transaortic gradient of 5 mmHg
4. Left ventriculography was not performed.

[**2200-2-25**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-27**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-10-19**],
the severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation has
increased. Estimated pulmonary artery pressures are higher.
Aortic stenosis is mild in severity.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 14330**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2200-2-24**] for a cardiac
catheterization and further management of her myocardial
infarction. A cardiac catheterization revealed two vessel
disease with severe instent restenosis of her circumflex artery.
Given the severity of her disease and the fact that she refused
to take plavix, surgical revascularization was decided upon.

Ms. [**Known lastname 14330**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner
including a carotid ultrasound which showed mild right and
moderate left internal carotid artery stenosis. Heparin was
continued and she remained without chest pain. The wound care
nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] for assistance with her coccyx ulcer and
appropriate dressings and barrier creams were applied. On
[**2200-2-26**], Ms. [**Known lastname 14330**] was taken to the Operating Room where she
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels.
Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively  she was
taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Over the next
several hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. Beta blockade, aspirin and a statin were resumed.
Diuresis towards her preoperative weight was begun.

The coccyx wound is being treated with Aquacel AG daily.
Surgical wounds are clean and dry. Pacing wires and CTs were
removed according to protocol. Bactroban was administered for
MRSA  positive nasal swab. Lopressor and digoxin were given and
advanced for rate control of her chronic atrial fibrillation and
diuretics were continued, to be so until she achieves her
preoperative weight.

fluid.  She received one dose of Clindamycin for unknown GBS
status.  She received epidural anesthesia.  There was no
maternal fever or fetal tachycardia.

The infant was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery.  Apgar
was seven at one minute and eight at five minutes.  She was
admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for treatment of
prematurity.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit, weight was 1.895 kilograms, 25th to 50th
percentile, length 41 centimeters and 10th percentile, head
circumference 29 centimeters and 10th percentile.  General,
the infant is a nondysmorphic infant in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - anterior fontanelle is
soft and flat.  Eyes with red reflux visualized both.  Ears
normally set without anomalies.  Palate intact.  Clavicles
intact.  Neck supple.  Chest - The lungs are clear to
auscultation, equal breath sounds, some periodic breathing.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, 2+
femoral pulses.  The abdomen is soft, positive bowel sounds,
no hepatosplenomegaly.  Genitourinary - normal female, patent
anus.  Spine - no sacral anomalies.  Extremities - hips
stable.  Extremities are pink and well perfused.  Neurologic
- normal and symmetrical tone and activity.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Respiratory - [**Known lastname **] required blow by oxygen briefly at the
time of admission and then weaned to room air.  She has been
in room air her entire Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
admission.  She has not had any episodes of spontaneous apnea
or bradycardia.

2.  Cardiovascular - A soft murmur was heard on day of life
two and has continued to be heard intermittently.  It is
consistent with peripheral pulmonic stenosis. No
cardiovascular sx or compromise. WIll need routine follow-up
by pediatrician.

3.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - [**Known lastname **] has p.o. feeds
from day of life one.  She has been breast feeding and bottle
feeding, taking in greater than 130cc per kilogram per day.
We supplemented her calories to 24 calories per ounce to
facilitate growth.  Her discharge weight is 1.87 kilograms.

4.  Infectious disease - Due to the unknown GBS status of the
mother and prematurity, [**Name (NI) **] was evaluated for sepsis.  A
white blood cell count was 11.2 with a differential of 25%
polys, 0% bands.  A blood culture was obtained prior to
starting intravenous Ampicillin and Gentamicin.  The blood
culture was no growth at 48 hours and the antibiotics were
discontinued.

5.  Gastrointestinal - Peak serum bilirubin occurred on day
of life one with a total of 6.6/0.3 mg/deciliter with
subsequent repeat levels lower with one most recently on
[**2176-10-30**], of a total of 3.6/0.3 direct.  She did not receive
any treatment.

6.  Neurologic - [**Known lastname **] has maintained a normal neurological
examination during admission and there were no neurological
concerns at the time of discharge.

7.  Sensory - Hearing screening was performed with automated
auditory brain stem responses.  The infant passed in both
ears.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mrs. [**Known lastname 7474**] is a 75 y/o female with advanced CKD and
ostomy, admitted with marked anion gap academia in setting of
increased ostomy output and some worsening of renal failure.

Anion Gap Acidosis.  delta delta initially favoring slight mixed
gap-nongap component, no osmolar gap.  Lactate normal.  Likely
related to worsening of renal failure and increased ostomy
output .  Does have a significantly low baseline (mid teens)
likely related to CKD and possibly RTA.  Urine lytes and gap c/w
RTA.
-  Hold further bicarb IV for now, likely restart PO bicarb.
will d/w renal.
-  Management of CKD below.

ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE STAGE V.
Worsened 3.0 ?????? 3.9 without appreciable drop in urine output
according to the patient and husband.  Now with improvement to
3.3.
- Awaiting renal's decision re: initiation of HD timing
- If HD this admit will need access; likely tunneled line; has
seen transplant as outpatient for access options.

INCREASED OSTOMY OUTPUT
- consider c.diff enteritis given recent antibiotics, elevated
WBC which responded with flagyl initiation, though would be rare
to have enteritis without colon.

- Continue IV flagyl for now

- Check stool culture and c.diff (2nd today).


ANEMIA.  Dropping steadily since admit; hct 22 today (30 at
admit).  No obvious bleeding source or hematoma.  Baseline B12
deficiency (repleted), MDS, CKD.
- check hemolysis panel today (?history of this in the past per
notes from several years ago)
-  T&S, would not transfuse unless <21
-  Consider restart of epo - both MDS and significant CKD.
- Guaiac ostomy output.

DYSPNEA.  Mostly exertional; likely related to acidemia and need
for significant respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis.
 Lungs clear on exam and imaging; oxygenating well.
- Treatment of acidosis as above

&#9658; CELLULITIS.  unclear if this is a new finding of
infection or related to venous stasis.  Was being managed by
derm as outpatient for venous stasis.
- Received 1000mg IV Vancomycin in the ED, would continue given
her improvement. Add on vanco level today
- Continue topical antifungal powder
- Bilat LE ultrasounds to r/o collections - done, negative for
collections.

UTI.  +U/A, cipro started.  Culture not sent at the time of UA
- check culture
- continue cipro x ~7 day course.

MACROCYTOSIS.  Ongoing x years.  Does have history of B12
deficiency, getting monthly IM replacement and normal B12 (and
folate) levels here.  Also with history of ?MDS, followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] in the past.

HYPERTENSION. Normotensive currently
- Holding CCBs with peripheral edema; will monitor today and
possible restart.

CAD
-  ?On aspirin daily ?????? will check into

GERD

- continue protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] (on at home)

MICU Course:
Patient noted to have shortness of breath in setting of low
bicarb and ongoing diarrhea.  Likely secondary to worsening
renal failure and increased ostomy output.  Patient initially
treated with IV bicarb, but as bicarb corrected, this was
stopped.  Noted to have elevated WBC so treated with vanco for
cellulitis (b/l thigh cellulitis clinically improving on vanco),
cipro for positive ua (UCx not sent), and flagyl for increased
ostomy output (though patient is s/p colectomy for UC which has
improved with flagyl).  Renal is still deciding whether or not
dialysis will be initiated.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year-old woman with
a past medical history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia
who was transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] for emergent
cardiac catheterization since she presented to that hospital
earlier this evening of admission with complaints of 6 out of
10 abdominal indigestion.  The patient noted back pain, but
denies nausea or vomiting.  Electrocardiogram showed ST
segment elevations about 6 mm in leads V2, V3 and 5 mm
changes in V5, 3 mm in V6 and 3 mm changes in leads 2 and
AVL.  The patient with old right bundle branch block and with
reciprocal changes in the inferior leads.  The patient was
given Lopressor, nitroglycerin and Integrilin at the outside
hospital with chest pain that decreased to 1.5 out of 10.  Of
note patient with similar complaints on Sunday.  At that time
those complaints were associated with nausea and vomiting as
well.  In the catheterization laboratory the patient
underwent stenting of the mid left anterior descending
coronary artery lesion due to 50% proximal and 50% first
septal and 100% mid occlusion.  The patient also underwent
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left
anterior descending coronary artery just beyond flow stent.
The patient had multiple infusions of intracoronary
nitroglycerin and Diltiazem to improve flow.  Hemodynamically
the patient's right atrium was a pressure of 10, PA of 42/21,
wedge pressure of 26, cardiac output 3.24, cardiac index
1.95, FVR 2100.  The patient was given 10 mg of intravenous
Lasix and transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Status post appendectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes a rash.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol 50 once a day.
2.  Lipitor 10 once a day.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for coronary artery disease.
Father with an aortic aneurysm.  Mother with a stroke.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Former tobacco smoker about half a pack per
day for five yeas.  Alcohol before dinner occasionally.  No
drugs.  She lives at home with her older sister.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 150/80.
Pulse 78.  O2 sat 96% on 2 liters.  In general, she is a
pleasant elderly woman in no acute distress.  HEENT
normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Mucous
membranes are moist.  Clear oropharynx.  Cardiovascular
regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  1 out 6 systolic
ejection murmur.  JVP at about 8 cm.  Lungs clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Extremities no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Good dorsalis pedis pulses and
posterior tibial pulses 2+ bilaterally.  Right groin arterial
sheath and Swan in place.  Skin no rashes or lesions.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 11.4, hematocrit
38.9, platelets 319, sodium 138, K 4.2, chloride 103, bicarb
26, BUN 23, creatinine 1.0, albumin 4.1, troponin 0.79.
Electrocardiogram as described previously.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 75 year-old woman with a history
of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia status post large
anterior myocardial infarction with placement of stent in the
mid left anterior descending coronary artery.  At
catheterization the patient was noted to have an elevated
wedge pressure and residual lesion of the left circumflex,
which was not intervened on.

1.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient has a large
anterior myocardial infarction and catheterization results as
noted above.  The patient was continued on aspirin, Plavix,
Integrilin for 18 hours and then discontinued.  Also
continued on heparin and beta-blocker was continued as
tolerated.  The patient was continued on her Lipitor 80 mg
and weaned off her nitro drip.  Otherwise the patient
remained mostly chest pain free throughout the course of her
stay.  She was started on a beta-blocker and titrated up as
tolerated and the patient was evaluated by the EP team for
possible risk stratification in the future secondary to her
anterior myocardial infarction and decreased ejection
fraction.  She did continue to have some episodes on
telemetry of tachycardia with exertion and plans were made to
have an outpatient Holter monitor and an outpatient stress in
six weeks time with T wave alternans at which time she will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] following those studies and to
reassess her obtuse marginal and right coronary artery
lesions for a possible reintervention.  The patient was also
started on low level Coumadin for three to four months of
anticoagulation for her anterior myocardial infarction and
hypokinesis of her anterior wall and decreased ejection
fraction.  For this she was also started on Lovenox as a
bridge waiting for Coumadin to become therapeutic and can
have this followed as an outpatient.  Goal INR of 1.5 at
which time she can discontinued her Lovenox.  The patient was
given teaching of her Lovenox during her stay and understood
injections.  Otherwise the patient was also started on ace
inhibitor to improve cardiac function and for her decreased
ejection fraction.

2.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient with an ejection
fraction of 35% after her anterior myocardial infarction.
She had akinesis of her mid distal and anterior septum,
distal anterior wall and apical akinesis and the patient was
continued on her ace inhibitor for after load reduction and
we started her on low dose Coumadin.  The patient's Is and Os
were monitored and she did receive some Lasix on a prn basis.
She was transfused one unit of blood for a hematocrit less
then 30 and was followed by a dose of Lasix as she had some
bibasilar crackles following the blood.

3.  Hematuria:  The patient had some hematuria, which was
likely secondary to a traumatic Foley placement during
admission, however, the patient was recommended to have
outpatient cystoscopy and urology follow up as she will get
this further evaluated once acute process is resolved.

4.  Nutrition:  The patient was continued on a cardiac diet
and her electrolytes were followed closely.  The patient was
seen and evaluated by physical therapy with no acute needs
for rehab or physical therapy.  The patient was ambulating
without difficulty or without desaturation or orthostasis.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.  Discharged with services for
Lovenox teaching.  The patient ambulating without difficulty
and not requiring oxygen.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Anterior wall myocardial infarction.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Hematuria.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lovenox 100 mg subq q day until INR greater then 1.5.
2.  Coumadin 5 mg po q day for three to four months with goal
INR of 1.5.
3.  Toprol XL 100 mg one po q day.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with her
primary care physician on [**Name9 (PRE) 2974**].  The patient is to have her
INR checked at that time and adjusted accordingly.  The
patient is to follow up with an outpatient neurologist and
establish herself with a local cardiologist once she sees her
local primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] she will follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2126-4-17**].  The patient will have a

delivered by cesarean section under spinal anesthesia
secondary to multiple gestation. The amniotic fluid was
clear. No maternal fever. No interpartem antibiotics. This
twin emerged with a cry, was dried, bulb suctioned. Apgar
scores were 9 at one minute and 9 at five minutes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:  Weight 2205 gm. Awake and
alert infant. Anterior fontanelle open, soft, flat. No
clefts. Red reflex deferred. Breath sounds clear and equal
bilaterally with easy work of breathing. No murmur. Normal
pulses and perfusion. Abdomen soft, nondistended, positive
bowel sounds, cord dry. Spine intact. Hips stable. Normal pre-
term female genitalia. Active with normal tone and activity

[**2156-11-20**], when draw bilirubin.

IMMUNIZATIONS RECEIVED:  Has not received hepatitis B
immunization yet.

IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED:  Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be
considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet
any of the following 4 criteria - 1) born at less than 32
weeks, 2) born between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of the
following - day care during RSV season, smoker in the
household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities, or
school-age siblings, 3) chronic lung disease, 4)
hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.

Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the fall
for all infants once they reach 6 months of age. Before this
age and for the first 24 months of the child's life
immunization against influenza is recommended for household
contacts and out of home caregivers.

Brief Hospital Course:
1)Upper GI bleed: Patient was on coumadin for recent hx of PE
and received 4 units of FFP and vit K in the EW to correct his
INR.  Coumadin was held intinitally for possible active bleed.
GI was consulted and EGD was done on [**2165-8-2**] which showed an
ulcer in the distal esophagus with active bleeding from that
site.  Successful clipping of the vessel was achieved using a
Resolution Endoclip device and then injected with epinephrine
for hemostasis.  Patient received total of 3 units of PRBC.
Patient was continued on PPI for prophylaxis and serial
hematocrit was done which remained stable (Hct>30).

2)Neuro: Patient has a hx of intracranial bleed s/p basilar
stent.  Patient on Plavix and [**Date Range **] for post-stent prophylaxis.
Patient remained lethargic which is his baseline.  He was able
to follow simple commands at times, moving his hands and feet
and occasionally giving verbal response.  Per family member,
patient appears to be more alert than before.  Neurosurgery
following this patient and strongly urged to hold Coumadin for
the risk of re-bleeding intracranially.  After discussion with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] from neurosurgery, it was decided to discharge patient
with Lovenox.

3)A-fib: During EGD proceduse, clipping of the bleeding vessel
was done and epinephrine was injected to that site.  Right after
the epinephrine was injected, he went into rapid afib to 150's
with ST depressions.  He was given a total of 10 mg of lopressor
with some decrease in his HR to the 120's-130's.  After 10 mg of
IV diltiazem, his HR came down to the 90's-100's and his BP
dropped to the 80's briefly.  MI was ruled out with serial
cardiac enzymes and he was given 25 mg of lopressor.  Patient
remained on sinus tachycardia, and lopressor was titrated up to
50 mg tid.  Patient did show good response to IV diltiazem 10
mg.

4)PE prophylaxis: Patient initially on Coumadin 12.5 mg qd and
Dalteparin 7500 units [**Hospital1 **], but were held due to GI bleed with
INR 2.9 and PTT 37.  Neurosurgery seen the patient and strongly
discouraged discontinuing Coumadin due to recent history of
intracranial bleed.  However, patient just had PE and is at risk
for another thrombotic event.  After discussion with the
neurosrugery attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**], it was decided to discharge
the patient with Lovenox.

5)ID: On [**8-4**] sputum gram stain showed gram positive cooci and
rhonchi on exam.  CXR intially appeared as LLL opacity so
Vancomycin 1 g q12 was started.  However after reviewing the
film with the team on [**2165-8-5**], CXR was more consistent with
fluid overload with effusion than consolidation.  Since patient
is afebrile with normal WBC and not showing symptom of
pneumonia, Vancomycin was discontinued.

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57 year old male
patient with known history of coronary artery disease, who
underwent a previous angioplasty with stent to the left
anterior descending in [**2183**].  He has had a recent increase of
shortness of breath and fatigue and his cardiac
catheterization on [**2187-7-25**], revealed a 70% left main
occlusion with normal left ventricular function.  He is
referred for coronary artery bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease with previous percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty.
2.  Atrial fibrillation times five years.
3.  70 to 100 pack year smoking history, quit two years ago.
4.  Asthma.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6.  Daily ETOH intake of two to six beers per day.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Ramipril 10 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Inderal 20 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Coenzyme Q10, 60 mg p.o. once daily.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies but
has had previous intolerable side effects from beta blockers,
which include insomnia, fatigue and impotence.

LABORATORY DATA:  Preoperative laboratory values were
unremarkable with the exception of baseline INR of 1.5.

Preoperative chest x-ray revealed chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease with bullous changes.  Preoperative
electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with no acute
ischemia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Preoperatively, his physical
examination was unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**2187-7-26**], where he underwent an off pump coronary artery
bypass graft times two with left internal mammary artery to
the left anterior descending and saphenous vein to the obtuse
marginal.  Postoperatively, he was on Neo-Synephrine,
Nitroglycerin and Propofol intravenous drip.  He was
transported from the operating room to the Cardiac Surgery
Recovery Unit in good condition.  On the day of surgery, the
patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and extubated.
The patient had some ventricular arrhythmias through the
course of the night of surgery felt to be related to his
pulmonary artery catheter. Once this was removed, he had no
further ventricular arrhythmia.  The patient remained on
Neo-Synephrine drip for a few hours the following day
postoperative day one, but ultimately that was weaned off
with blood pressure above 90 systolic and the patient was
asymptomatic tolerating that well.  The patient had his chest
tubes removed on peripheral pulses day one and begun beta
blockers and diuretic.  The patient began cardiac
rehabilitation on postoperative day two, began to ambulate on
the telemetry floor, was placed on intravenous Heparin drip
due to his chronic atrial fibrillation and Coumadin was
initiated the evening of postoperative day two.  The patient
progressed with cardiac rehabilitation over the next couple
of days and has remained hemodynamically stable in atrial
fibrillation with a resting heart rate of about 100.  His
beta blocker was increased.  His Coumadin was given at his
preoperative dose of 5 mg p.o. once daily  His INR had not
yet bumped.  After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] and the patient,
it was felt appropriate for the patient to have his Heparin
discontinued and allow him to be discharged home on his
preoperative Coumadin dose.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Neurologically, the patient is
intact with no apparent neurologic deficits.  On pulmonary
examination, his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac examination is irregular rate and rhythm.  His
abdomen is obese, soft, benign.  His sternal incision is
clean and dry with no erythema and no sternal drainage.  He
does, however, have a small amount of serosanguinous drainage
oozing from his chest tube site.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Percocet one to two tablets q4-6hours p.r.n. pain.
4.  Ibuprofen 400 mg p.o. q6hours p.r.n. pain.
5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. twice a day times seven days.
6.  Potassium Chloride 20 meq twice a day times seven days.
7.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once daily.
8.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. today, [**2187-7-30**], tomorrow [**2187-7-31**],
and then he is to have an INR checked and the results are to
be called to the patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1683**], whose office will dose continued Coumadin.  They have
been contact[**Name (NI) **] and have agreed to do this and the patient has
the appropriate information regarding Coumadin dosing to be
done by his primary care physician.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged in good
condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft.

?Guillain-[**Location (un) **]


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy and bronchial lavage: 8/3
[**2162-7-29**] 1. Total laminectomy of C3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.
2. Fusion C3 to 7.
3. Autograft and allograft.


History of Present Illness:
82 y/o male with PMHx breast CA s/p mastectomy in [**5-/2162**] c/b
right frozen shoulder, squamous cell CA of the penis s/p
resection, glaucoma who is being transferred for concern of
Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.  Per the pt's niece, he was in his
usual state of health until [**7-24**], when he fell while unloading a
piece of furniture from his car.  Per OSH notes, he did not lose
conciousness nor complain of any cardiac prodrome - he felt this
was a mechanical fall.  He was too weak to get up on his own and
was on the ground for ~2 hours prior to being found by his
neighbor.  [**Name (NI) **] was taken to [**Hospital3 **] and admitted to a
telemetry unit.  He was noted to have elevated CK, which peaked
at 3320, then trended down with IVF.  Cardiology was consulted
but felt this was a mechanical fall and had planned to obtain an
echocardiogram.  On [**7-25**], the patient was noted to have
increased weakness and progressed to a feeling of an inability
to move his extremities on [**7-26**].  Shortly after this, he became
bradycardic and hypotensive and went into respiratory failure.
He was intubated, had CPR performed, then was transferred to the
CCU.  He was intermittently on pressors and was felt to have
developed an aspiration pneumonia.  He was initially on
clindamycin, then broadened to vancomycin and cefepime.  His O2
requirement improved and there were plans to extubate him on
[**7-28**], however a NIF was noted to be -10 and the patient was noted
to have complete paralysis of bilateral extremities.  CT was
negative, neuro consulted and felt he may have an ascending
paralysis such as GBS and recommended transfer to a tertiary
care facility.
.
In the ICU, the patient is intubated.  He is able to shake his
head yes and no to questions.

Imaging:
CXR ([**7-28**]):
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] ([**8-24**]: FINDINGS: There is exaggerated lordosis of the
cervical spine. There is
minimal retrolisthesis of C4 over C5 vertebra by 4 mm. The
vertebral bodies
are normal in height and marrow signal intensity. There is no
evidence of
acute fracture.
Prevertebral soft tissue is noted from C1 to C5 level.

Hyperintensity is noted in posterior paraspinal muscles and soft
tissues from
C1 to C6 levels. A small hypointense area is noted in right
paraspinal
muscles at the C7-T1 level measuring 1.8 x 1.4 x 1.7 cm in
craniocaudad, AP,
and transverse dimensions. This likely represents calcification.


There is multilevel disc degenerative disease. There is
desiccation of all
cervical intervertebral discs.

At C2-C3 level, there is no significant spinal canal or neural
foraminal
narrowing.

At C3-C4 level, there is a broad-based posterior disc protrusion
causing
indentation and compression of spinal cord. There is severe
spinal canal
stenosis. The disc with uncovertebral and facet osteophytes
causes moderate
bilateral foraminal stenosis.

At C4-C5, there is posterior disc protrusion causing indentation
and
compression of the spinal cord and severe spinal canal
narrowing. The disc
with uncovertebral and facet osteophytes causes moderate right
and mild left
foraminal narrowing.

At C5-C6, there is diffuse posterior disc bulge causing
indentation of the
anterior subarachnoid space. There is no evidence of significant
spinal canal
or neural foraminal narrowing.

At C6-C7 level, there is diffuse posterior disc bulge without
significant
spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.

Hyperintense signal is noted in cervical spinal cord from C2 to
C7 level.
This likely represents combination of compressive edema and
contusion
secondary to fall.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o male with PMHx breast CA s/p mastectomy in [**5-/2162**] c/b
right frozen shoulder, squamous cell CA of the penis s/p
resection, glaucoma with neurologic signs concerning for
cervical spine injury vs GBS vs myositis.
.
# Weakness/paralysis - Concerning for cervical spine injury (may
have occurred during intubation) vs ascending paralysis such as
GBS vs myositis/myopathy given elevated CK on admission.
Patient has no clear history of prodromal illness for GBS, but
this is not necessary for the diagnosis.  CK trending down
without any intervention for myositis making it less likely.  MR
[**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] performed early [**7-29**] showed chronic DJD of C-spine with
significant narrowing of spinal canal, compression of spinal
cord, and associated edema from C3-T1.  Spine surgery was
consulted and felt that the paralaysis is secondary to spinal
cord compression with poor prognosis if patient taken to the OR
and very low probability of recovery of any function.  Spine
surgery had a discussion with family who chose to pursue
surgical repair.

.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure - [**1-27**] diaphragmatic weakness and
pneumonia/mucus plugging.  CXR on presentation showed complete
whiteout of left lung - bronchoscopy the evening of [**7-28**] showed
copious amounts of mucus plugging that was suctioned out.  Post
bronch, has been able to be weaned to 60% FiO2.  A repeat CXR on
[**7-29**] showed substantial improvement, with possible consolidation
in the LLL.  Due to neuromuscular dysfunction, he was continued
on ventilation.
.
# HCAP - Signs of LLL PNA seen on bronchoscopy with edematous,
red airways.  Was thought to have aspirated at OSH and covered
with vanco/cefepime.  Has been in hospital > 48 hours so needs
to be covered for HCAP.  Plan to continue coverage and request
sputum culture results from OSH.
.
# Thrombocytopenia - Platelets of 114 on [**7-28**], down from 147 on
admission to OSH.  No signs of spontaneous bleeding at this
time.  Differential includes med effect vs decreased production.
.
# Anemia - Mild normocytic anemia.  On admission Hgb was 14.7.
[**Month (only) 116**] be [**1-27**] dilution vs decreased production vs bleed (although
no evidence).  Plan to follow CBC.
.
# Elevated AST/ALT - mildly elevated, other LFTs are normal
including bili.  [**Month (only) 116**] be related to periods of hypotension.  Plan
to trend LFTs.
.
# Bradycardia - Bradycardic at OSH, has been stable here.  [**Month (only) 116**]
be secondary to [**Last Name (un) 4584**]-[**Location (un) **] or other neuro problem affecting
autonomic nervous system.  Presumably, was ruled out for MI
after this happened but unknown if this did happen.  EKG shows
no evidence of infarct.  Echo planned for [**7-29**], may be deferred
given emergent surgical intervention.
.
# Elevated CK - Likely secondary to rhabdo from fall, CK's have
been trending down without acute intervention and renal function
is stable.
.
# FEN: IVF as needed, replete electrolytes, NPO for now
# Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots and subQ heparin
# Access: peripherals
# Communication: Patient
# Disposition: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] trauma ICU
for possible surgical intervention per Spine surgery

In the evening of [**2162-7-30**], after discussion with patient and
family members, the patient's code status was changed to Comfort
Measures Only. His pain was controlled with IV morphine. At
1030pm, the patient was noted to have no respiratory drive, no
pulse and no heart/lung sounds. The on call resident was called
to evaluate the patient, and the patient was pronounced dead at
1040pm on [**2162-7-30**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname 75017**] [**Known lastname **] is the former 1.135
kilogram produce of a 31-2/7 week gestation pregnancy born to
a 33-year-old G1, P0 now 1 woman. Prenatal screen: Blood type
A-, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive,
hepatitis B surface antigen negative, group beta strep status
unknown. The mother's medical history was complicated by
pneumonia requiring initiation of steroids. She continued on
her steroid taper into her pregnancy. She developed
gestational diabetes most likely secondary to the steroid
taper. She was also a smoker and has an anxiety disorder. She
suffered a cerebral vascular accident at age 18. She was
monitored closely for the known intrauterine growth
restriction and was noted to have absent diastolic flow on
the day of delivery. She was taken to cesarean section for
nonreasurring fetal heart rate tracing. There was large
amount of blood noted at the time of delivery. The infant
emerged apneic and required positive pressure ventilation and
blow-by O2. Apgars were 5 at one minute and 7 at five minutes
and 8 at 10 minutes. He was admitted to the neonatal
intensive care unit for treatment of prematurity.
Anthropometric measurements at the time of admission to the
neonatal intensive care unit: Weight 1.135 kilograms, less
than the 10th percentile, length 37 cm 25th percentile, head
circumference 24.6 cm, less than 10th percentile.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON DISCHARGE:  Weight 1.345 kilograms,
length 39 cm, head circumference 27 cm. General: Well
appearing preterm male in room air. Skin warm and dry. Color
pink. Well perfused. Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat,
anterior fontanel open, level, sutures opposed, eyes clear,
palate intact. Positive red reflex bilaterally. Chest: Breath
sounds clear, equal, easy respirations. Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur. Normal S1, S2, femoral
pulses +2. Positive palmar pulses. Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended. No masses. Positive bowel sounds. Cord remnant
on and drying. Extremities: Moving all stable hips. Neuro:
Active with exam. Symmetric tone and movements. Positive
suck, positive grasp.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY
DATA:
1. Respiratory: This infant required treatment with
    continuous airway pressure upon admission to the
    neonatal intensive care unit. His respiratory distress
    resolved and he weaned to room air by day of life #1. He
    continued in room air through the rest of his neonatal
    intensive care unit admission. He has had rare episodes
    of spontaneous apnea and bradycardia that have been
    monitored and with no further treatment provided. At the
    time of discharge he is breathing comfortably in room
    air 40-60 breaths per minute with oxygen saturations
    greater than 96%.
2. Cardiovascular: This infant has maintained normal heart
    rates and blood pressures. An intermittent murmur was
    noted from day of life 5 through 6 and is not audible at
    the time of discharge. Baseline heart rate is 130-170
    beats per minute with a recent blood pressure of 56/28
    mmHg, mean arterial pressure of 46 mmHg.
3. Fluids, electrolytes, nutrition: This infant had initial
    hypoglycemia requiring treatment with 20% glucose and
    water. He had an umbilical venous catheter placed for
    central access. Enteral feeds were started on day of
    life #2 and gradually advanced to full volume. He
    successfully weaned from the high glucose intravenous
    solution and has been off intravenous fluids for the 72
    hours prior to delivery. He is currently being fed 150
    mL per kilo per day of preemie Enfamil 28 calorie per
    ounce formula. His serum glucoses have been 57-80 mg per
    deciliter. At the time of discharge he weighs 1.345
    kilograms. Serum electrolytes were checked several times
    in the first week of life and were within normal limits.
4. Infectious disease: Due to his respiratory distress and
    presentation at the time of birth and the unknown group
    beta strep status of his mother, this infant was
    evaluated for sepsis upon admission to the neonatal
    intensive care unit. A white blood cell count and
    differential were within normal limits. A blood culture
    was obtained prior to starting intravenous ampicillin
    and gentamycin. The blood culture was no growth at 48
    hours and the antibiotics were discontinued.  Urine CMV
    was sent but was negative.
5. Hematological: This infant is blood type O+ and is
    direct antibody test negative. His hematocrit at birth
    was 38. He did not receive any transfusions or blood
    products. He is being treated with supplemental iron.
6. Gastrointestinal: This infant required treatment for
    unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy. Peak
    serum bilirubin occurred on day of life at 6.1 mg per
    deciliter. He was treated with phototherapy for
    approximately 96 hours. Most recent rebound bilirubin on
    [**2167-11-20**] was 1.6/0.5 mg per deciliter.
7. Neurology: A head ultrasound was performed on day of
    life #5 and showed a left germinal matrix hemorrhage.
    Repeat head ultrasound on [**2167-11-25**] showed the
    previously mentioned left germinal matrix hemorrhage but
    stable and no increased ventricular size. This infant
    has maintained a normal neurological exam during his
    admission.
8. Sensory: Audiology hearing screening has not yet been
    performed. It is recommended prior to discharge.
    Ophthalmology: This infant will require screening eye
    exams for retinopathy of prematurity starting at
    corrected age 33-34 weeks.
9.  Placenta: The placental pathology was normal.
10. Psychosocial: This mother was very ill postoperatively
    from her cesarean section. She remained hospitalized
    until [**2167-11-25**]. The infant is being retro
    transferred to [**Hospital **] Hospital upon her request. [**Hospital1 35990**] social work was involved
    with this mother. The contact social worker is [**Name (NI) 4457**]

2. Medications. Ferrous sulfate 25 mg per mL dilution, 0.1
    mL p.o. once daily; vitamin E 5 units pg once daily.
3. Iron and vitamin D supplementation: Iron supplementation
    is recommended for preterm and low birth weight infants
    until 12 months corrected age. All infants fed
    predominantly breast milk should receive vitamin D
    supplementation at 200 international units (may be
    provided as a multivitamin preparation) daily until 12
    months corrected age.
4. Car seat position screening is recommended prior to
    discharge.
5. State newborn screens were sent on [**11-16**] and
    [**2167-11-27**]. There has been no notification of
    abnormal results to date.
6. Immunizations. No immunizations have been administered
    thus far.
7. Immunizations recommended: Synagis RSV prophylaxis
    should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for
    infants who meet any of the following four criteria:
    1) Born at less than 32 weeks;
    2) Born between 32 and 35 weeks with two of the following:
       Daycare during RSV season, a smoker in the household,
       neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities, or school
       age siblings;
    3) Chronic lung disease
    4)Hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease

Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the fall
for all infants once they reach 6 months of age. Before this
age and for the first 24 months of the child's life,
immunization against influenza is recommended for household
contacts and out of home caregivers.

This infant has not received rotavirus vaccine. The American
Academy of Pediatrics recommends initial vaccination of preterm
infants at or following discharge from the hospital if they are
clinically stable at at least 6 weeks but fewer than 12 weeks
of age.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Prematurity at 31-2/7 weeks' gestation.
2. Intrauterine growth restriction.
3. Transitional respiratory distress.
4. Suspicion for sepsis ruled out.
5. Apnea of prematurity.
6. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

with LIMA-LAD,SVG-OM1, SVG-OM2. Her bypass time was 73 minutes
with a crossclamp of 58 minutes. She tolerated the operation
well and was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition. She
received vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics.  In the
intensive care unit she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated without complications.  On
post operative day one she was started on beta blockers and
diuretics and transferred to the floor.  Physical therapy worked
with her on strength and mobility. On post operative day two her
chest tubes were removed.  Her epicardial wires were removed the
following day.  She was gently diuresed toward her pre-operative
weight. Her activity level gradually advanced and by
post-operative day four she was discharged to home with the
approval Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].  All follow-up appointments were advised
per cardiac surgery protocol.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old male who
was previously hospitalized in [**2117-6-1**] for a large right
sided subdural hematoma, which developed while he was on
Coumadin on atrial fibrillation with no history of trauma.
The patient underwent bedside drainage of subdural hematoma
without complication, and was discharged off Coumadin.
Patient had a four week followup CT which showed a left sided
subdural hematoma with 5 mm rightward shift.  The patient
denies any current symptoms.  However, his wife noted
difficulty with gait and occasional tripping prior to
admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Atrial fibrillation.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Anxiety.
5. Questionable pulmonary embolus on [**7-4**].
6. Status post IVC filter in the right groin.

Patient neurologically was awake, alert, and oriented times
three and slightly anxious with equal pupils and full
extraocular motions on initial exam.  Patient had a
questionable right pronator drift with a slight facial droop,
but motor strength was [**4-5**] throughout upper and lower
extremities on admission.

Patient was admitted to the floor and preoped for craniotomy
and left subdural evacuation, which he underwent on [**2117-8-27**]
without complication.  Subdural drain was placed.  The
patient was transferred to the PACU status post procedure.
Patient was placed on fluid restriction on [**8-28**] for a sodium
of 132.  Patient's repeat head CT showed some postoperative
air in the left subdural space and some layering of fluid.
Drain was placed.  There is scant drainage in the subdural
drain since OR.  Drain was flushed on [**10-1**], and [**8-29**]
without significant change in the amount of drainage.
Patient continued to neurologically remain intact
postoperatively.

Patient's drain was D/C'd on [**8-29**] without sequelae.  The
patient was transferred to the floor.  Patient had no
complaints at the time of discharge.  Was neurologically
stable at time of discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Zolpidem tartrate 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
2. Phenytoin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
3. Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Lorazepam 1 mg p.o. q.4-6h. prn.
6. Peroxetine 40 mg p.o. q.d.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed to

Date of Birth:  [**2118-10-29**]        Sex:  M

Service:  Neonatology

HISTORY:  This is a 27-1/7 week infant who is now being
transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**], 7 North for further care
due to diagnosis of a colonic stricture following medical
necrotizing enterocolitis.

The infant was born to a 34 year-old gravida II, para I, now
II mother with prenatal screens A positive, antibody
negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, hepatitis B
surface antigen negative, and group B strep unknown.
Benign antepartum course until mother presented with vaginal
bleeding and was admitted to the [**Hospital1 188**]. She was started on magnesium sulfate and given a complete
course of betamethasone. Magnesium sulfate was discontinued and
mother had further bleeding and concern for abruption. Due to
this concern for abruption and mother's decreasing platelet count
the infant was delivered by cesarean section on [**2118-10-29**]
at 6:57 p.m., 20 minutes post onset of general anesthesia.
Ruptured membranes at delivery for clear fluid, no maternal
fever, no intrapartum antibiotics. The infant initially had
decreased spontaneous respiratory effort likely
secondary to general anesthesia. Heart rate about 60,
received bag mask ventilation with improved heart rate to
over 100 . Apgars of 2 at one minute, 6 at five and 7 at nine.
[**Hospital **] transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit without
incident.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Weight of 1110, which is
65th percentile. Length of 38 cm, which is 60th percentile.
Head circumference of 26.5 cm, which is 65th percent.
Anterior fontanelle open, flat. Palate deferred. Regular rate
and rhythm without murmur. 2+ peripheral pulses including
femorals. Breath sounds fairly clear with symmetric air
entry. Abdomen benign without hepatosplenomegaly or masses. A
3 vessel cord was noted, normal male genitalia for
gestational age with right testicle palpable high in the
scrotum. Normal back and extremities. Skin pink and well
perfused. Decreased spontaneous movement.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Respiratory: [**Known lastname **] was initially intubated and required
    surfactant x2. He was extubated to CPAP on day of life #8
    which was [**11-6**], after being loaded with caffeine
    citrate. He was then placed on CPAP of 6 with FIO2 30
    to 40% and this continued until he developed
    medical necrotizing enterocolitis. Then [**Known lastname **] was taken
    off of CPAP and placed on nasal cannula on [**12-5**] and
    he has continued in nasal cannula up until this date. He
    had received maximum flow of 1 liter of room air
    humidified and now has weaned to today's nasal cannula
    setting of 100 cc on room air. He is currently breathing w/
    respiratory rate of 30 to 60s and he continues on his
    caffeine citrate with 1 to 2 spells a day.

2.  Cardiovascular: There was a murmur noted on day of life
    #2 and an initial echocardiogram showed a PDA. He received
    one course of indomethacin.  A repeat echo on [**11-3**]
    showed a small PDA that was about 1 mm and a follow up on
    [**12-6**] at the time of his necrotizing enterolitis showed
    no ductus arteriosus.

3.  Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition: Infant's birth weight
    was 1110. His most recent weight today is 2520 grams and
    his most recent head circumference on [**12-12**] was 30 cm
    and a length of 44 cm. Initially
    [**Known lastname **] had been n.p.o. with an umbilical arterial and an
    umbilical venous line in place. He was slowly started
    feedings on day of life #7 and slowly advanced to full
    feedings on day of life #10 and he was then advanced to
    breast milk 30 with beneprotein, was doing well without any
    intolerance until day of life #37 on [**12-5**] when he
    was noted to have grossly bloody stool. Please see GI
    system for rest of GI issues but he was made n.p.o. at
    that time and due to diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis
    remained n.p.o. until [**12-20**] and he was started
    slowly on feeds. He had been advanced to 30 cc per
    kilogram per day as of today and was noted to have
    abdominal distention. A KUB showed mildly dilated loops
    throughout the entire bowel. Continue to gastrointestinal
    for further information.

4.  GI: As noted earlier, he presented with grossly bloody
    stool on [**12-5**], on day of life #37 and was made
    n.p.[**Initials (NamePattern5) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 37079**] was placed to low wall suction. He had
    evidence of medical necrotizing enterocolitis with KUB
    showing multiple areas of pneumatosis over the next 1 to
    2 days. Bowel wall appeared thickened in different
    locations. He never had any perforation. His CBC was
    significant for a bandemia with 25 bands that increased
    to 27 bands the following day and later normalized. His
    electrolytes remained stable throughout as well as his
    platelets which were not lower than 494 after he had the
    necrotizing enterocolitis. Today, in the setting of the
    increased abdominal distention on the KUB and his high risk
    for a stricture, he was sent over to [**Hospital1 **] radiology for
    a barium enema and a transverse colonic stricture was
    identified.

5.  Hematology: He did receive phototherapy and had a peak
    bilirubin on day of life #1 of 4.5. His initial
    hematocrit was 45.5%. He did receive 1 blood transfusion on
    [**11-2**] for a hematocrit of 34. He did receive a
    second blood transfusion on the day of his diagnosis of
    medical necrotizing enterocolitis. His most recent hematocrit
    was on [**12-20**] of 26.6 % with a retic count of 3.2.

    His platelets have remained stable throughout the entire
    course and he has not received any platelet transfusions.

6.  Endocrine: [**Known lastname **] had normal sugars in the first 2 weeks
    of life and on day of life 18 was noted to have a D-stick
    of 36 and he then continued over the next 1 to 2 weeks to
    have intermittent low D-sticks and endocrinology consult
    had been obtained and recommended sending an insulin
    level as well as growth hormone, urine for ketones,
    cortisol, and a blood gas if the blood D-stick was <50.
    However, this did not recur and these tests were never
    assessed. As a result of his previous history of low D-sticks
    which were presumed to be a period of hyperinsulinemia, we
    have not advanced his TPN glucose beyond 12.5 trying not
    to induce hyperinsulinemia as he was weaned off the PN with
    refeeding.

7.  Infectious disease: He did receive an initial rule out
    sepsis in the first 48 hours. His initial white count was
    5.8 with 11 polys and 0 bands with ANC of 638. His blood
    cultures were negative and antibiotics were
    discontinued after 48 hours. ON [**12-5**], he was started on
    vancomycin and gentamicin after he had grossly bloody stools
    with the significant bandemia of 27 bands. This was changed
    to Zosyn after initial blood cultures were negative and he
    continued on Zosyn to complete a total of 16
    days, which was 2 days after the KUBs normalized. The
    Zosyn has been discontinued since [**2118-12-20**].

8.  Neurology: He has had 2 head ultrasounds, which have been
    normal ([**11-3**], [**11-29**]).  He will
    need a third ultrasound at term corrected gestational
    age.

9.  Ophthalmology: He had his initial eye examination on
    [**2118-11-28**]. It showed zone 2 immature. Follow up 2
    weeks. On [**12-12**] he had a right stage 1, zone 2, 1
    to 2 o'clock hours and left eye was immature with follow
    up in 1 week. On [**12-19**] he had right ROP stage 1,
    zone 2, 2 to 3 o'clock hours and the left was immature in
    zone 2 and follow up in 1 week. This follow up eye
    examination will need to be done at [**Hospital3 1810**]
    in the last week of [**Month (only) 1096**].

10.  Immunizations: He did receive 1 dose of hepatitis B
    vaccine on [**11-30**] and will be due to for his first
    set of immunizations over the next week.

PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 45269**].

CONDITION AT TRANSFER:  Critical.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To [**Hospital3 1810**] level 3 for
surgical repair of the colonic stricture.

CARE RECOMMENDATIONS AT DISCHARGE:
1.  Feedings: N.p.o.
2.  Medications: Caffeine
3.  Car seat positioning has not been done as of yet but will
    need to be done prior to infant's discharge home.
4.  Newborn state screen status: He has had multiple state
    screens with 11/11 state screen normal.  A recent repeat
    state screen sent on [**2118-12-11**] is still pending at
    this time and will need to be followed.
5.  Hearing screen status has not been done at this time but
    will need to be done prior to infant's discharge.
6.  Immunizations received: As noted above, hepatitis B
    vaccine and infant will require first set of vaccinations
    within a week.
7.  As noted above, will require a repeat HUS at term gestational
    age.
8.  As noted above, repeat ophthalmologic exam is due next week.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Ascites, scrotal swelling, shortness of
breath and lower extremity edema.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55 year old male with
infarction times two, status post four vessel coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2135-3-6**], hypercholesterolemia,
hypertension, and congestive heart failure, who reports he
has had increased swelling of his abdomen and legs with
swelling of the scrotum which has progressed over two to
three weeks' time.  He also has had associated and frequent
shortness of breath and inability to move.
He was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] where he was
admitted on the [**3-9**].  There, he was
assumed to have biventricular failure as the cause of his
edema.  He received Zaroxolyn and Bumex, but his BUN and
creatinine elevated.  An abdominal ultrasound showed
splenomegaly and a renal consult thought patient was
pre-renal and therefore, the patient's diuresis was withheld
except for Spironolactone.  ACE inhibitor was held as well.

A cardiac ultrasound was attempted but the study was limited
by obesity and Cardiology there recommended a MUGA Scan which
showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, good
biventricular function.

A paracentesis was done on [**1-11**], of two liters.  The
studies showed 400 white blood cells, 520 red blood cells, no
polys, 41 lymphocytes, 59 monocytes, glucose 126, total
protein 3.9, LDH 110 and Enterococci grew out which was
treated with Ampicillin one gram q. eight hours.  For a
hematocrit of 25 he was transfused two units of packed red
blood cells.  Repeat paracentesis on [**1-13**] drew off
five liters; this was done only for the patient's comfort and
no studies were sent.

A BUN and creatinine on discharge were 127 and 3.8.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were 97.9 F.; 140/72; 56;
20; 97 on room air; 170 kilograms.  On examination, the
patient was in no apparent distress.  Oropharynx clear.
Mucous membranes were moist.  Heart showed regular rate and
rhythm.  Normal S1, S2.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, distended with
splenomegaly.  Extremities with two plus edema bilaterally.

LABORATORY:  Chem 7 as follows:  137, 5.7, 102, 27, 127, 3.8,
153 glucose.  Calcium 8.9, iron 53, TIBC 298, hemoglobin A1C
7.3, TSH 17.

Ascites with Enterococci sensitive to Ampicillin and
sensitive to Vancomycin.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 55 year old male with a history
of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, significant coronary
artery disease, but good ejection fraction on a recent MUGA
scan, obesity, hypertension, and lower extremity edema with
shortness of breath times two to three weeks.  He had his
first paracentesis in an outside hospital recently with
unclear etiology of his edema.

A Cardiology consultation was obtained and a repeat
echocardiogram was done to work-up the cause of his edema.
This study was extremely limited and the left ventricular
ejection fraction could not be estimated, but the systolic
function  of  the left ventricle did not seem to be severely
depressed. The right ventricle was not well seen.  Thickened
aortic and mitral leaflets, and a right ventriculogram could be
done if further quantification was to be done.

In addition, the patient had an ultrasound of his right upper
quadrant to determine whether flow was abnormal.  This showed
a diffusely increased echogenicity in the liver consistent
with fatty liver.  Portal venous flow with hepatopetal
direction and a normal hepatic reflow.  The spleen was mildly
enlarged.  There were mild ascites but no other abnormality
on this ultrasound.

The patient had paracentesis of five liters of fluid in-house
which was clear and yellow.  The fluid showed 310 white blood
cells, total protein of 3.2, albumin of 1.7, glucose 162, LDH
100, amylase 26, gram stain negative and a culture was
pending.

Hepatitis serologies were also sent to determine whether
there was some evidence of liver dysfunction accounted by
Hepatitis.  HIV negative, Hepatitis B surface antibody
negative.

The patient was maintained on a cardiac low-salt diet of less
than 2 grams per day and diuretics were initially held
secondary to the question of prerenal azotemia.  The Renal
Service was consulted regarding this patient and acute renal
failure was thought to be secondary to ACE inhibitors plus
diuretics plus/minus infection, with the intention to restart
Bumex 2 twice a day once the patient's creatinine reached its
baseline.

A right heart catheterization was performed while the patient
was in-house to find the etiology of his symptoms as well as
transfer to Liver biopsy.  The catheterization showed
equalization of pressures consistent with a constrictive
physiology.  He was aggressively diuresed with Lasix
overnight while in the Cardiac Care Unit.  The patient had
increased right and left heart pressures as well as
cirrhosis.  He was continued on a regimen of Lasix 40 twice a
day and Aldactone 100 q. day, aiming for minus 1.5 liters off
per day.  It was decided that creatinine could be tolerated
as high as 2.5.  There were no further recommendations from
renal at this time, and the patient was cleared for
discharge.  Ampicillin was also given in-house while the
patient had an Enterococcus in his prior peritoneal fluid.

Chief Complaint:
transferred from OSH for pericardial effusion found on
echocardiogram


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis


History of Present Illness:
82 [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 76663**] RN with hx of non-hodgkins lymphoma (dx in [**2122**])
 thought to be in remission s/p XRT, atrial fibrillation on
coumadin, labile HTN, hyperlipidemia, and anxiety who initially
presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**12-14**] with 2 day history of
shortness of breath.
She says that she felt well when she developed gradual onset of
shortness of breath which was worse with exertion and lying
flat.  Denies any chest pain or palpitations.  She normally
receives her care at [**Hospital6 **] but asked her son to
drive her to [**Name (NI) 26580**].  Of note, she has a history of pericardial
effusion found on Echo performed in [**Month (only) **] of this year as a
prelude to a cardiac stress test.  At that time her cardiologist
referred her to oncology.  Patient says her oncologist was
absolutely certain that this effusion was not a result of her
NHL.  She says she did not receive any more work-up at that
time.
.
At [**Last Name (un) 26580**], she had a repeat ECHO which showed a large
pericardial effusion measuring 4cm posteriorly and 3cm
anteriorly.  Her vital signs remained stable (124/70's and a HR
60-90's afib) and she was transferred for pericardiocentesis and
further work-up of the effusion.  Given her elevated INR (4.1)
she received 10mg of SQ Vit K as well as a repeat Echo prior to
transfer.
.
The transfer note also reports that patient was ordered for a
unit of blood prior to transfer for a HCT drop from 29 --> 26,
but that she did not receive it prior to transfer.  Patient
denies any BRBPR, or other abnormal bleeding.  She had a
colonoscopy this year and had a polyp excised, but it was
otherwise normal.

On review of systems, she does have a history of myalgias and
joint pains (chronic, has hx of OA), black stools in the setting
of iron supplementation, mild cough (non-productive), and
syncope, last episode in [**2123**].  She also recently has some R leg
swelling for which she had an U/S performed but she does not
know the results.  The swelling has since resolved.
.
She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
hemoptysis, red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, recent syncope or presyncope.

TTE [**12-17**]:

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a small pericardial effusion measuring 0.9cm
around the inferior and inferolateral left ventricle with
minimal effusion around the apex and anterior right ventricle. A
catheter is seen in the pericardial space.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-12-16**],
the pericardial effusion is much smaller and tamponade
physiology is no longer suggested.

TTE [**12-16**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated. The
right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-23**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
large pericardial effusion. Stranding is visualized within the
pericardial space c/w organization. There is brief right atrial
diastolic collapse. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be
absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.

Cath [**12-17**]:
1.  Pericardiocentesis was performed with needle entry from the
subxiphoid position.  1100cc of bloody fluid was removed and
sent for
studies.
2.  Pulsis paradoxus is difficult to assess due to atrial
fibrillation.
3.  Right heart catheterization prior to pericardiocentesis
shows
elevated and equalized diastolic pressure which were equal to
the
pericardial pressure (for details see above).  Subsequent to
removal of
1100cc of pericardial fluid, pericardial pressure decreased to
1mmHg.
Left ventricular filling pressure remains elevated and unchanged
with
(22mmHg) greater than RVEDP (14mmHg) suggesting underlying
diastolic
dysfunction. Given bifid RA waveform, there maybe a component of

constrictive physiology.
4.  Pulmonary hypertension with PA systolic pressure of 49mmHg
prior to
pericardiocentesis and 56mmHg after pericardiocentesis.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. pericardial tamponade.
4. possible co-existing constrictive physiology.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 82 [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 76663**] RN with hx of non-hodgkins
lymphoma, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, labile HTN,
hyperlipidemia, and anxiety who is transferred from [**Hospital 26580**]
Hospital for pericardiocentesis of symptomatic pericardial
effusion of unknown etiology.
.
#. pericardial effusion: Hemodynamically stable on admission.
However on the evening of [**12-16**], she was hypotensive transiently
to 90s after being given labetalol.  SBP back up to 110s
following fluid bolus of 500cc.  Pulsus increased from 6 to 12
overnight.  However, due to INR of 4.1 at OSH,
pericardiocentesis held until [**2128-12-17**]. At the OSH she had an
INR of 4.1 was given 10 mg sq vitamin k.  Here she was given 10
mg po vit K x 2.  Her INR was 1.8 when she was sent to the cath
lab for pericardiocentesis with 1 unit of FFP to be given in the
holding area.
.
Underwent pericardiocentesis with drainage of 1100cc of bloody
fluid with resolution of tamponade. Residual 0.9mm effusion
noted on post-procedure ECHO. Pulsus [**7-29**].  Drain in place
overnight with minimal output. Pulled day post procedure. Pulsus
followed for worsening and was stable. Patient discharged to
home shortness of breath resolved.
.
#. Rhythm: Has atrial fibrillation, on coumadin, digoxin and
labetalol at home. Reversed coumadin and labetalol initially
held for hypotension. Restarted labetalol day after procedure.
Coumadin started after drain was pulled.
.
#. HTN: Patient was on lisinopril and norvasc until recently,
which were both stopped by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5310**] at OSH. Labetalol
held as became hypotensive. Later, during pericardiocentesis,
developed hypotension. Started briefly on nitro drip. Patient
improved rapidly when transitioned back to home dose labetalol.
.
#. UTI: Pt with foul-smelling urine [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, and thus u/a sent.
Urinalysis c/w UTI, and thus being treated for 3 days with
ciprofloxacin.  Urine culture + for pansensitive E. coli.  She
has a history of recurrent yeast infections with antibiotics.

IDENTIFICATION:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 75483**] is a 1-day-old former 32-6/7
week infant who expired this afternoon in the [**Hospital1 18**] NICU
secondary to cardiopulmonary failure from severe pulmonary
hypoplasia.

HISTORY:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 75483**] was born on [**2199-12-4**] at 8:56 p.m.
as the 2175 gram product of a 32-6/7 week gestation pregnancy
to a 30-year-old gravida 1, para 0 mother with estimated date
of delivery of [**2199-1-24**]. Prenatal laboratory studies
included blood type B+, antibody negative, RPR nonreactive,
rubella immune, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and
group B strep unknown. The pregnancy was complicated with the
development of severe bilateral hydronephrosis, presumed
bladder outlet obstruction and progressive oligohydramnios
beginning at approximately 19 week' gestation. The mother was
followed closely by the [**Hospital **] Care Center at [**Hospital3 18242**] including Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 61096**] from Urology, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37080**]
from Surgery. Mother underwent 2 attempted vesicoamniotic
shunt placements at 21 weeks and again at 24 weeks. Both
catheters initially achieved bladder drainage but
subsequently migrated from the bladder. The mother received a
course of betamethasone at 24 weeks. No other abnormalities
were noted on ultrasound and most likely diagnosis was
thought to be posterior urethral valves.

On the day of delivery, mother presented in preterm labor.
Due to the presumed intrauterine location of the previous
shunts, mother was taken for [**Name (NI) 32007**] delivery. Membranes
were intact at the time of delivery and there were no
specific sepsis risk factors noted.

In the delivery room, the patient emerged with moderate tone
but poor respiratory effort and cyanosis. Status appeared to
improve with bag mask ventilation and heart rate was always
greater than 100. Infant was intubated in the delivery room
and then brought to the NICU. Apgar scores were 6 and 7.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial examination was
notable for a somewhat edematous 32-week gestational age
infant with several areas of bruising in the arms, the scalp
and legs. Mild deformational abnormalities of the ears were
noted. Lungs had very distant breath sounds that required
significant pressures with positive pressure ventilation to
aerate. Heart exam was regular rate and rhythm without
murmurs. Abdomen was noted to be quite distended in the lower
segment. Testes were not descended.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. RESPIRATORY:  Infant was initially placed on
    conventional ventilation of SIMV with settings of 35/5
    with a rate of 40. Initially, oxygen saturations were
    reasonable with FIO2 of 100%. However, secondary to
    inability to adequately ventilate, infant was quickly
    changed to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.
    Infant received 2 doses of surfactant and escalated in
    ventilator settings to a MAP of 24 and amplitude of 52.
    Over the course of the first hospital night, infant had
    persistent difficulty with ventilation as well as
    increasing difficulties with oxygenation eventually
    prompting the initiation of nitric oxide at
    approximately 8 hours of life due to persistent
    inability to achieve oxygen saturations above 60%.
    Infant status transiently improved with achievement of
    oxygen saturations of 90-100%; however, PO2 in blood
    gases consistently remained under 50. At approximately
    12 hours of life, infant experienced a further
    deterioration with a prolonged period of desaturation
    with oxygen saturations in the 60-70% range. Numerous
    maneuvers were attempt including increase of ventilator
    settings, volume support, and increase of nitric oxide
    with eventual improvement of oxygenation on settings of
    a MAP of 26, amplitude of 60 and nitric oxide of 40 ppm.
    However, approximately 1 hour later infant experienced
    an acute decompensation with severe desaturation and
    severe hypotension that was found to be due to the
    development of a right-sided pneumothorax. This was
    drained initially with multiple procedures of needle
    thoracentesis. Status initially improved but then
    remained quite tenuous. A right-sided chest tube was
    placed without notable improvement. Infant's status
    continued to fluctuate with eventual further
    decompensation leading to severe bradycardia,
    hypotension and hypoxia. A left-sided pneumothorax at
    that time was noted which was drained by needle
    thoracentesis without improvement.

2. CARDIOVASCULAR:  Umbilical venous catheter, umbilical
    arterial catheter were placed on admission. Over the
    first couple hours of life infant required blood
    pressure support with normal saline boluses as well as
    initiation of dopamine. Systemic blood pressure was
    attempted to be maintained in a generous range due to
    presumed pulmonary hypertension. Infant initially
    appeared to stabilize on a dopamine of 15 mcg/kg/min but
    subsequent deterioration in status eventually resulted
    in dopamine of 25 mcg/kg/min, as well as additional
    volume support with a total of approximately 5 boluses
    of normal saline. Preductal and postductal oxygen
    saturations were measured and were found to have a 10 to
    15-point gradient suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.
    Cardiology consultation was obtained on the morning of
    [**2199-12-5**], and an echocardiogram at that time showed
    evidence of pulmonary hypertension with systemic right-
    sided pressure, right-to-left shunting at the PFO,
    bidirectional shunting at the PDA, and mild to moderate
    ventricular dysfunction.

3. FEN:  Infant was maintained on maintenance IV fluids
    from admission with fluid restriction to 60-80 cc/kg/D
    secondary to unclear renal function. Blood sugars and
    blood chemistries over the first 12 hours of life were
    largely within acceptable range. Due to the prenatal
    diagnosis of bladder obstruction, a Urology consultation
    was obtained after birth and a Foley catheter was placed
    by the Urology with difficulty. Following placement of
    the Foley catheter, a large amount of urine was drained,
    approximately 190 cc. This urine was found to have a
    sodium concentration of 131 mEq/L similar to serum.
    Subsequently to the initial drainage, very little urine
    output was seen, although it was not zero. A renal
    ultrasound was performed which revealed a severely
    dysplastic left kidney with diffuse cystic changes, a
    right kidney with severe hydronephrosis and an echogenic
    cortex although overall architecture was within normal
    limits, and a bladder with severely thickened wall. The
    bladder was empty on ultrasound with the catheter in
    place.

4. ID:  Initial CBC and blood culture were sent on
    admission. White blood cell count was 22.4 thousand with
    26% polys, 5% bands, 43% lymphs and 23% atypical lymphs.
    Initial hematocrit was 52 and platelets were 177. Infant
    was begun on ampicillin and cefotaxime. Blood culture
    was sent and is negative at time of this dictation.

5. GI:  A bilirubin at 12 hours of life was measured and
    was 2.3/0.2.

6. NEURO:  Shortly after admission, infant was maintained
    on sedation with fentanyl due to the precarious
    cardiopulmonary status. Eventually, the infant received
    muscle relaxation with Pancuronium due to difficulties
    with maintaining ventilatory support. Infant was
    maintained on muscle relaxation and sedation with
    fentanyl subsequently.

7. DISPOSITION:  At approximately 15 hours of life, the
    infant was noted to experience an acute decompensation,
    as mentioned above, related to pneumothorax. Despite
    aggressive interventions, infant's status remained
    precarious. Eventually, infant developed bradycardia
    with heart rates to the 40s and 60s in a setting of
    severe hypoxia and severe hypotension. Cardiopulmonary
    resuscitation was begun with chest compressions and
    administration of several doses of epinephrine.
    Transient improvement in heart rates were seen but these
    were not persistent. The parents were brought to the
    bedside and after a discussion of the severity of the
    infant's illness and the extremely low likelihood of
    survival, the parents asked for resuscitative measures
    to be stopped. CPR was given for approximately 15
    minutes for a total of 4 doses of epinephrine, chest
    compressions and administration of volume and
    bicarbonate. Intensive care measures were stopped at
    1:05 p.m. Parents held their child briefly and the
    infant expired at 1:23 p.m. Cause of death was
    cardiopulmonary failure presumably secondary to
    pulmonary hypoplasia, respiratory distress syndrome and
    pulmonary hypertension. Underlying diagnoses included
    prematurity, bladder outlet obstruction, renal failure
    and presumed posterior urethral valves.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Expired. [**Location (un) 511**] Organ Bank and
medical examiner were notified and both declined
participation. The family agreed to a full autopsy.
Obstetrician, Dr. [**MD Number(4) **] [**Name (STitle) **], was notified.

NAME OF PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  Not identified in chart.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Prematurity at 32-6/7 weeks.
2. Presumed posterior urethral valves.
3. Bladder outlet obstruction.
4. Presumed pulmonary hypoplasia.
5. Respiratory distress syndrome.
6. Pulmonary hypertension.
7. Sepsis evaluation.

Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Choking.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old female
with severe Parkinson's disease found unconscious and
unresponsive with agonal breathing.  Family reports the
patient choked on some chicken.  They proceeded to do CPR and
the Heimlich and retrieved some chicken with fingers.
Patient emergently was intubated at the scene, and afterwards
her vitals were a pulse of 161, blood pressure 150/88.  Pulse
came down to 100 and she was 98% on 100% O2.  Patient
received a 500 cc bolus of normal saline.

In the Emergency Department, patient's vitals were pulse 118,
blood pressure 171/64, respiratory rate 17, and 100% O2.  Of
note, the family thinks the patient was choking on chicken
for about three minutes and was totally nonresponsive without
palpable pulse for about two minutes.

Also of note, the patient is on her 6th day of treatment for
urinary tract infection with Cipro.  Family states that the
patient was slightly more fatigued, but otherwise at her
baseline with severe Parkinson's disease, and not oriented.
Patient had good po intake, no other localizing signs.  There
is a question of a transient ischemic attack 2-3 weeks ago.

In the MICU, patient was found to have right lateral gaze and
deviation, and was sent for head CT scan.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals:  Pulse 124, blood pressure
147/64, respiratory rate 14, and O2 saturation 100%, vent set
at SIMV respiratory rate of 12, tidal volume of 500, PEEP of
5, and FIO2 of 100%.  In general, the patient is awake, but
intubated.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally
anteriorly.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs,
or gallops.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended,
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  2+ pedal pulses, no
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neurologic:  Right lateral
gaze deviation, no movement past midline, pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Moves both
upper extremities spontaneously, increased rigidity
diffusely, Babinski upgoing bilaterally.

LABORATORIES:  White count 18.5, hematocrit 38.2, platelets
505.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.1, chloride 101, bicarb 21, BUN
22, creatinine 1.0, glucose 149.  Arterial blood gas:  7.36,
41, 233.

CHEST X-RAY:  Rotated, ETT in good position, no
cardiopulmonary infiltrates.

HEAD CT SCAN:  No hemorrhage.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Normal sinus rhythm at 118 beats per
minute, left axis deviation, normal intervals, Q waves in V1
through V2, no change from [**2103**].

Echocardiogram from [**2104-4-4**]:  Ejection fraction of 40%,
mild-to-moderate hypokinesis in the anteroseptal and apical
walls, RV normal.

EGD from [**2108-3-5**]:  Hiatal hernia, grade II esophagitis,
Barrett's.

C-scope from [**2108-3-5**] shows grade I internal
hemorrhoids.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 78-year-old female with
a history of severe Parkinson's, multiple falls, who presents
status post choking.  Patient most likely had
temporary-complete airway obstruction and possible pulseless
electrical activity.  The patient was emergently intubated
and required no defibrillation.

1. Pulmonary:  The patient has no known lung disease.
Because of her episode and fear of any residual foreign
objects, the patient was bronched.  This revealed no evidence
of upper airway obstruction.  Patient's vent was changed from
SIMV to CPAP with pressure support.  She was taking good
ventilations with very little sedation.

The patient was noted to have very thigh secretions on
suctioning.  There was a question of aspiration pneumonia
especially given elevated white count.  Discussion took place
with the daughter, who is the proxy.  Decision was made to
extubate the patient despite the large volume of secretions.
The daughter was well aware of the risks, benefits.  If the
patient remained intubated, she would be much more likely to
develop vent-acquired pneumonia.  If she was extubated, there
was a significant risk of drowning in secretions.

The patient's daughter chose the latter choice, according to
her what she thought her mother would want.  There was no
plan to reintubate once extubated.  Patient was extubated on
[**2109-2-19**].  Following extubation, the patient became
tachypneic and uncomfortable.  Patient's comfort was
maximized with Morphine drip.  Because of the revised goals,
the patient was transferred to the floor.

The following day, she was transferred to hospice care.

2. Heme:  The patient was noted to have a hematocrit drop
from 38.2 to 30.3.  She was also having coffee-grounds
suctioned.  Her hematocrit further decreased to 25.  The
patient was treated with 2 units of packed red blood cells.
Her hematocrit came up to 32.  The patient had no further
coffee-grounds, and he hematocrit stabilized.  No nasogastric
lavage was performed.  Hematocrit came up to 32 and remains
stable.

3. Infectious Disease:  The patient developed a fever,
although her white count came down.  Fever was up to 101.3.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were negative.  Chest x-ray
showed no sign of infiltrate.  No antibiotics were initiated.

4. Neurologic:  Patient has known severe Parkinson's on
Sinemet.  Although despite the lateral gaze deviation, the
patient's head CT scan was negative.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Carbidopa/levodopa 25/100, one tablet po tid.
2. Morphine prn.
3. Lansoprazole.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is discharged to hospice
care.  She is to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1266**] as needed.
Patient's other medications can be restarted according to the
wishes of the family and PCP.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Respiratory arrest status post foreign object removal.
2. Possible pulseless electrical arrest secondary to complete
airway obstruction.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleed, status post 2 units of
packed red blood cells.
4. Parkinson's.

Service:  Cardiology

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86 year old male with
a past medical history of lung cancer, status post
pneumonectomy, abdominal aortic aneurysm, aortic valve
disease, history of peptic ulcer disease who presents with
shortness of breath and chest pain two days prior to
admission.  The patient states that three days prior to
admission he had difficulty sleeping secondary to general
discomfort, difficulty lying flat, secondary to shortness of
breath, and some stuttering right-sided chest pain.  However,
the patient was unable to sleep through the night.  One day
prior to admission, during the night again, the patient had
more difficulty sleeping secondary to worsening shortness of
breath when lying flat and more frequent episodes of
right-sided chest pain.  He states that he sat up in bed for
most of the night and could not sleep at all the night prior
to admission.  He denies any nausea or vomiting, no
diaphoresis, no palpitations.  The day of admission, the
patient states that after returning from the grocery store
the patient thought he was going to collapse.  He states his
whole body felt weak, extremely short of breath and he noted
a small amount of hemoptysis.  The patient presented to the
Emergency Room in a taxi cab.  In the Emergency Room, the
patient was noted to be short of breath, he was speaking in
short sentences.  His respiratory rate was 36 and oxygen
saturation was 71% on room air.  His blood pressure at that
time was 164/103.  His heartrate was 126.  He was noted to
have coarse breathsounds throughout.  The patient was placed
on 100% nonrebreather face mask.  Electrocardiogram showed a
sinus tachycardia to 115 with some J point elevations in
leads V2 through V3 as well as incomplete left bundle branch
block.  He was given Lasix 80 mg intravenously times two,
nitroglycerin drip was started and he was also given some
Morphine 2 mg intravenously and Lopressor 2.5 mg
intravenously times two.  In the Emergency Room his
creatinine kinase was 1209 with an MBI of 19, troponin was
2.7.  The patient was started on heparin.  His blood pressure
decreased to 115/70.  The patient was unable to wean off of
100% nonrebreather mask.  The chest x-ray was consistent with
pulmonary edema.  After receiving the Lasix in the Emergency
Room, the patient was feeling much better.  The patient has
denied shortness of breath and denies chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Lung cancer, status post partial
pneumonectomy.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm.  History of peptic
ulcer disease.  Aortic valve disease.  Gout.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin
2.  Lipitor
3.  Allopurinol

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco use, no alcohol use.  The patient
lives with his daughter in the [**Name (NI) 1426**] [**Name (NI) 26498**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission
revealed temperature 98.2, heartrate 81, blood pressure
110/71, respiratory rate 32, oxygen saturation was 95% on
100% nonrebreather facemask.  In general the patient appeared
comfortable, lying in bed at an angle of 30 degrees on a
nonrebreather mask.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  His
right pupil was cloudy.  His left pupil reactive to light.
Sclerae anicteric.  Oropharynx clear.  Moist mucous membranes.
Cardiovascular examination:  Regular rate and rhythm, he has
a normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops audible.
His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with active
bowel sounds.  His lungs, coarse breathsounds throughout.
Extremities, no edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission his white blood cell count was
13.1, hematocrit 35.9, platelets 153.  His MCV was 110,
sodium 141, potassium 4.8, chloride 107, bicarbonate 20, BUN
54, creatinine 3.8, and glucose 257.  His creatinine kinase
on admission was 1209 with an MB of 328, MB index of 19 and
troponin of 2.71.  Urinalysis on admission:  Yellow, clear,
1.025, 100 protein, 0-2 red blood cells, 3 white blood cells,
rare bacteria, [**3-27**] epithelial cells.  Chest x-ray showed a
pulmonary edema with a left pleural effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Floor after his respiratory status improved after receiving
Lasix in the Emergency Department.  Over night the patient
remained stable, however, the next morning the patient was
noted to be more hypotensive and to be in increasing
respiratory distress.  In addition, the patient had a
traumatic Foley catheter insertion and developed some
significant hematuria.  The Urology Service was consulted and
the patient was started on continuous bladder irrigation with
resolution of the hematuria.  Due to his worsening
respiratory status, the patient was taken immediately to
catheterization for evaluation of possible blockage, given
that the patient ruled in for myocardial infarction.  The
patient was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit post
catheterization.  Catheterization showed left main coronary
artery disease with a 20% ostial stenosis.  Left anterior
descending artery has a 90% mid stenosis involving D2, as
well as 60% ostial/proximal stenosis.  There was also 80%
left circumflex stenosis and 80% proximal right coronary
artery stenosis.  PTCA and stenting was performed during
catheterization, on the left circumflex and on the mid left
anterior descending.  During the catheterization,
the patient was emergently intubated for worsening
respiratory status.  It was thought the patient was in
cardiogenic shock secondary to an anterolateral myocardial
infarction.  The patient was started on Dopamine drip. He
was also started on Natrecor drip to diurese.

In the Intensive Care Unit the patient was noted to have
acute renal failure with creatinine increasing to 5.1.  It
was thought this likely secondary to the dye load from the
catheterization in the setting of chronic renal
insufficiency.  The patient was also noted to have a
temperature spike to 101 degrees F.  The patient received
Vancomycin times one and was started on Levofloxacin and
Flagyl.  The patient was slowly weaned off of Dopamine and
extubated on [**2199-11-22**].  The patient was continued on
a heparin drip on transfer to CCU.  The patient developed a
hematocrit drop from 35.9 to 27 to 23.  The heparin was
discontinued and the patient was transfused 2 units of red
blood cells with improvement of his hematocrit to 30.8 prior
to transfer out of the Intensive Care Unit.  While in the
unit the patient continued to demonstrate congestive heart
failure.  The patient was treated with Hydralazine and
Isordil as well as Lasix intravenously prn urine output.  The
patient had a renal ultrasound which documented no
hydronephrosis bilaterally.  The ultrasound did show that the
renal cortices were thin and that the kidneys were overall
small in size suggestive of some element of chronic renal
disease.  The patient was transferred out of the Intensive
Care Unit on [**2199-11-25**].  At the time of transfer, the
patient was afebrile, his heart rate was 93, his blood
pressure was 124/55.  Respiratory rate was 18 and he was
sating 95% on 4 liters nasal cannula oxygen.  In terms of his
cardiovascular disease, the patient was continued on his
Aspirin, Plavix, statin as well as Carvedilol on transfer to
the Medicine Floor.  The patient remained chest pain free
throughout the remainder of the hospital stay.  In terms of his
congestive heart failure, the patient was noted to have an
ejection fraction of less than 15% with global severe
hypokinesis to akinesis. He appeared euvolemic on transfer to the
Medical Floor, however, he was noted to have some coarse crackles
at the base bilaterally.  The patient was diuresed with Lasix
intravenously.  In addition, the patient's Hydralazine was
increased to 25 t.i.d. with a goal dose being 75 mg p.o.
t.i.d.  He was also continued on his Isosorbide which was
increased to 20 mg t.i.d. with a goal dose being 40 t.i.d.
The medications were increased as blood pressure permitted
with a goal systolic blood pressure of greater than 90.
Given the patient's decreased ejection fraction, the patient
should have an electrophysiology consult as an outpatient
regarding implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement.

Concerning the patient's renal failure, his acute renal
failure was secondary to dye load during catheterization and
was noted to improve from a creatinine 5.2 on transfer to 3.6
prior to discharge.  The patient was able to maintain good
urine output throughout the remainder of the hospitalization.
It was felt that this renal function would likely continue to
improve.  In terms of his fluids, electrolytes and nutrition,
the patient was continued on pureed, soft/solid diet and
slowly advanced to solids, 2 gm sodium-restricted diet.  The
patient was also continued on Boost t.i.d. per Nutrition
recommendations.  The patient was noted to become
hypernatremic and slightly hyperchloremic with Lasix diuresis
and Lasix was appropriately decreased.  The patient was also
encouraged to drink free water.

In addition during the hospital stay the patient was noted to
have increased blood sugars that were likely secondary to the
stress of acute illness.  He was maintained on insulin
sliding scale after transferred out of the Intensive Care
Unit to the Medical Floor.  The patient's blood sugars should
be followed and the patient may need to be started on oral
hypoglycemic agents in the future if his blood sugar does not
improve.

By [**2199-11-27**], the patient's mental status had much
improved, respiratory status was stable, his creatinine was
improving and it was thought the patient was stable for
transfer for further rehabilitation and physical therapy at
[**Hospital3 **].

Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, the patient is a
52-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of alcohol
abuse who was diagnosed with alcoholic cirrhosis on this
admission.  He was admitted on [**10-3**] with eight episodes
of hematochezia and melena and one episode of hematemesis on
the day of admission.

The patient called the Emergency Medical Service.  His blood
pressure was found to be 80/palp with a heart rate in the
130s.  He was transferred to the Emergency Department.
Hemodynamically, the patient was stabilized.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's hematocrit was
found to be 16.9.  The patient was transfused 4 units of
packed red blood cells, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma, and
intravenous proton pump inhibitor.  He was started on an
octreotide drip and intravenous erythromycin.  The patient
had an nasogastric tube lavage which was positive for bright
red blood.  The Gastrointestinal Service was consulted for an
emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Alcohol abuse.
2.  Question diabetes mellitus.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Multivitamin.
2.  Vitamin A.
3.  Vitamin B.
4.  Vitamin C.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his partner.  [**Name (NI) **]
drinks a 6-pack of alcohol and half a pint of gin every
evening for the past several years.  He quit tobacco 10 years
ago.  He has no history of intravenous drug use or illicit
drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission to the Medicine Service revealed the patient's
blood pressure was 131/78, his heart rate was 70, his
respiratory rate was 16, and his oxygen saturation was 96% on
room air.  In general, the patient was a pleasant
African-American gentleman in no apparent distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed he did have
scleral icterus.  The oropharynx was clear.  The mucous
membranes were moist.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate and rhythm.  Respiratory examination revealed
the patient's lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally
with decreased breath sounds at the bases and crackles at the
left base.  The abdomen was soft, distended, and nontender.
He had tympanitic bowel sounds throughout.  There was no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremity examination revealed he had 1+
edema to the his knees.  His pulses were 2+.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
on admission to the Medicine Service revealed the patient's
hematocrit was 30.3.  His Chemistry-7 was within normal
limits.  His INR was 1.8.  His hepatology series was positive
for HBAB antibody.  At this point, all cultures were negative
to date.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF INTENSIVE CARE UNIT COURSE:  At this point,
the patient was intubated for airway protection.  The
esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed active bleeding from the
gastric varix.  The patient had 2+ bleeding varus in the
esophagus.  The bleeding site was injected with epinephrine
and morrhuate sodium to sclerose the varix; however, the
bleeding did not subside.  He was then treated with
intravenous vasopressin and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube was placed. The
[**Last Name (un) **] tube remained in place until [**10-4**].  He had no
more episodes of bleeding.  The Pitressin was discontinued;
however, the patient remained to be hypertensive.  A sepsis
workup ensued, and he was started on Levophed as his
hypertension did not respond to fluid boluses.

On [**10-5**], the patient had a right upper quadrant
ultrasound to see if there was enough ascites to tap.
Minimal fluid was tapped.  At this point, the patient became
febrile.  An echocardiogram was done which showed that he had
no vegetations, but there was possibly a left lower lobe
pneumonia.  Therefore, the patient was started intravenous
antibiotics.

On [**10-6**], the [**Last Name (un) **] tube was removed.  During his
Intensive Care Unit course, the patient was weaned off
pressors.  He was dependent on fresh frozen plasma during his
hospital course due to his coagulopathy secondary to his
liver disease.

On the evening of [**10-7**], the patient was extubated.  He
tolerated this well.  His vital signs were stable.  His
hematocrit had been stable in the 30s for over 24 hours, so
the patient was called out to the Medicine floor for further
treatment.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL/VARICEAL BLEED ISSUES:  The patient was
followed by the Liver Service throughout his hospital course.
His hematocrit levels had remained stable.  He was maintained
on twice per day Protonix.

He had a repeat endoscopy on [**10-9**] which showed that he
had varices or cardia at the gastroesophageal junction and at
the lower one-third of the esophagus.  This varix was banded
successfully.  He also had an ulcer in the gastroesophageal
junction and cardia and blood in the body and antrum of his
stomach.

The patient was started on carafate 1 g four times per day.
He was continued on Protonix twice per day, and he was
started on nadolol and titrated up as tolerated.  However,
during his hospital course the nadolol had to be discontinued
given that he had worsening renal function.  In order to
maximize renal perfusion, the nadolol was discontinued.

Per the patient's computed tomography, it appeared that the
patient had chronic pancreatitis.  He did have significant
steatorrhea during his hospital stay; however, he was
asymptomatic.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient had spiked a
fever on [**2138-10-6**] and was continued on ceftriaxone
and vancomycin in the Intensive Care Unit.  As his cultures
had been negative for any suspicious organisms, his
vancomycin was discontinued, and he was continued on
ceftriaxone during his hospital course.

He had a repeat paracentesis done on [**10-11**] which showed
no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.  He
remained afebrile and was completing the course for his left
lower lobe pneumonia.

The patient had been on stress-dose steroids in the Intensive
Care Unit.  On [**10-10**], as it appeared that the patient
had not been septic and remained afebrile, his stress-dose
steroids were discontinued.

3.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was extubated on [**10-7**].  He had no respiratory issues during his Medicine Service
stay.

4.  ENDOCRINE ISSUES:  For the patient's diabetes mellitus ?
secondary to steroid use ? previous to his admission, he
remained on fingersticks four times per day and an insulin
sliding-scale as needed.

5.  RENAL ISSUES:  During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, he
had acute renal failure which started on [**10-9**].  His
creatinine increased to 1.1.  The source of his renal failure
was unclear.  Initially, this was thought to be an acute
tubular necrosis secondary to his hypotension while in the
Intensive Care Unit; however, it persisted so it was likely
secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.

The patient's diuretics were discontinued.  he was started on
intravenous albumin infusions daily.  He was continued on his
octreotide in order to maximize renal perfusion.

During his hospital course, upon until [**10-12**], the
patient's creatinine continued to rise.  Therefore, on
[**10-12**], the nadolol was discontinued and he was started
on Trental 400 mg by mouth three times per day and midodrine
75 mg by mouth three times per day.

6.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient
remained nothing by mouth during his hospital stay in the
Intensive Care Unit.  His diet was advanced on [**10-11**],
and the patient tolerated this well.

The Medicine Service tried to optimize his nutritional status
with additional Boost supplements and Mighty shakes.

7.  HEMATOLOGIC/COAGULOPATHY  ISSUES:  The patient was
admitted with an INR of 2.6, and it appeared that he was
dependent on fresh frozen plasma in order to reverse his
coagulopathy; however, during his hospital course an empiric
trial of vitamin K was started on  [**10-9**].

8.  CONSULTATION ISSUES:  The Addiction Service and Social
Work were consulted, and the patient will likely continue
with an outpatient detoxification treatment.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
 1.  Alcoholic cirrhosis.
 2.  Ascites.
 3.  Alcohol abuse; continuous.
 4.  Acute renal failure secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
 5.  Coagulopathy.
 6.  Esophagitis.
 7.  Hypoalbuminemia.
 8.  Esophageal varices with bleed.
 9.  Hypophosphatemia; repleted.
10.  Hypokalemia; repleted.

NOTE:  The patient was to be discharged at a later date, and
someone else will complete the Discharge Summary at that
time.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11344**]
Chief Complaint:
status epilepticus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
HPI; 64 yo LHM with hx L MCA hemorrhagic stroke in [**2158**] with
subsequent seizure disorder (Status epilepticus in [**Month (only) 205**] and fall
of [**2168**] with full return to baseline, but event [**12-31**] lasting 30
minutes at [**Hospital6 33**] with subsequent poor functional
status), and multiple recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**].  He was
transferred from [**Hospital 38**] Rehab to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2170-2-22**] for evaluation
of generally depressed mental status and concern for possible
sub-clinical epileptic events vs. oversedation from his AEDs and
was admitted for long-term monitoring.  At time of initial
presentation ([**2-22**]) his AEDs included VPA 1500 mg q12h and
Carbatrol 300 mg TID.  Prior AEDs include PHT, keppra, and
lamictal (although full details unknown).  EEG [**2-22**] showed
encephalopathy without epileptiform features.  EEG [**2-24**] showed a
single seizure lasting 90 seconds with rhythmic epileptiform
discharges in left temporal region without video correlate,
presumed to be complex partial seizure.  MRI brain [**2-26**] showed
multiple chronic infarcts and microvascular disease, and a small
right parietal subdual collection.  CSF, thyroid studies, and
RPR
were normal.  CBZ-10,11-epoxide level was elevated and depakote
was subsequently discontinued and he was started on zonisamide.
He was discharged [**3-9**] to rehab facility on zonisamide 300 mg
qhs
and carbamazepine 300 mg tid but returned the following day,
[**3-10**]
s/p fall at [**Hospital1 1501**].  Circumstances surrounding the fall were
unclear
and he was unable to provide a reliable history.  CT head showed
5 mm [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and 4 mm extra-axial hematoma and R parafalcine
blood.
He was discharged [**3-15**] with no evidence of seizures during
hospital course and returned [**3-22**] for increasing agitation,
reported to be ""urinating in the lobby, going into patients
rooms, and difficult to re-direct"" as per his most recent
admission note.

Today while at his nursing home, he was noted to be found
unresponsive, and then had a witnessed GTC seizure lasting
possibly one hour.  Unfortunately, details of this event are
rather limited.  He initially presented to [**Hospital3 934**]
hospital where he was noted to be ""actively seizing with
generalized shaking.""  VS were T 102.4, BP 185/76 RR 28 glucose
187.  He received 5 ml valium, 2 mg ativan, and 1g PHT which
stopped the seiuzre.  He later was intubated after receiving
etomidate and succynlcholine at 4:30 PM.  His examination prior
to transfer was notable for sluggish pupils and ""unresponsive to
painful stimuli.""

Upon arrival in ED here, T 100.8 (rectal), P 91, BP 170/76 RR
16,
sat 100% on vent.  He has received CTX, vanc, acyclovir, and
dexamethasone.  CT head showed R 4mm SDH and R subdural hygroma.

ROS unobtainable.


Past Medical History:
1. L. MCA territory hemorrhagic stroke in [**2158**].  Known
hypertensive at the time, not on medications.  Records suggest
that temporal and occipital lobes were most-affected.  Residual
moderate aphasia and mild R. hemiparesis.
2. GTCS since this stroke, beginning 2-3y after hemorrhage.
Seizures were self limited, lasting 1-2 minutes, and occurred
2-4x per year.  In [**June 2169**], had an hour-long episode of status
epilepticus.  Two subsequent episodes of status, no self-limited
seizures since that time.  Refractory to multiple medications -
previously on Keppra, Lamictal, and Dilantin (height of doses
unknown), currently Carbatrol and Depakote.
3. Coronary artery disease, CABG x 3 vessels in [**4-29**].  Wife

Imaging:

MRI [**4-1**]
FINDINGS: There is a small focus of hyperintensity in the right
side of the
pons on diffusion images, best visualized on image 8, series
702. Subtle
hypointensity is also seen on ADC map in this area. Although
this could
represent an acute infarct, the appearances are unusual and this
could be an
artifact as well. If there is a persistent clinical concern for
a brain stem
infarct, a repeat study could help.

There is a chronic-appearing subdural hematoma seen in the right
frontoparietal region with a maximum width of approximately 8
mm. There is
focus of edema is seen in the right frontal lobe with a
well-defined area of
late subacute blood products. This area of blood products were
seen on the CT
of [**2170-3-11**]. No abnormal enhancement is identified in this
region. Given
that the edema has slightly increased compared to the prior CT,
this could
likely be due to post-seizure edema in this location. Moderate
changes of
small vessel disease and chronic left basal ganglia and left
occipital lobe
infarct with blood products are seen. These chronic infarcts are
unchanged
from prior study. Following gadolinium, no abnormal parenchymal,
vascular or
meningeal enhancement is seen.

IMPRESSION:

1. Small area of late subacute blood products in the right
frontal lobe with
surrounding edema. Although the blood products were seen on the
previous CT
of [**2170-3-11**]. The surrounding edema is slightly more prominent
accounting for
differences in slice selection. This could presumably be
post-seizure, edema.
No abnormal enhancement is seen in this location.

2. Subtle signal abnormality within the right side of the pons
on diffusion
images could represent a small acute infarct but the appearance
is more
suggestive of an artifact. If there is continued concern, a
repeat diffusion
image can help.

3. Subacute chronic-appearing right-sided subdural hematoma
without
significant midline shift.

4. Chronic left occipital and left basal ganglia infarcts.

5. No abnormal enhancement.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86382**] is a 64 yo LHM with hx L MCA hemorrhagic stroke in
[**2158**] with subsequent seizure disorder including multiple
episodes of status epilepticus in the past,
presenting after status epilepticus, resolved after receiving 5
mg valium, 2 mg ativan, and 1 g PHT.  He is intubated, but his
examination off sedation appears nonfocal.  While he has had
prolonged seizures in the past, likely secondary to his known
structural lesion (prior stroke), his fever (T 102.4 at arrival
to OSH) may be concerning for infectious precipitant of this
event.

Hospital Course:

#Neuro:  Mr. [**Known lastname 86382**] was admitted for status epilepticus, for
which he initially received 5mg Valium, 2mg Ativan and 1 gram
dilantin, and was intubated for airway protection.  He was
febrile initially, but had a normal LP.  His carbemazepine was
kept at the same dose.  His level on admission was 3.7, however
repeat trough was 9.2 on his usual dose of medication, raising
the question of whether he may have missed a dose prior to
admission.  His Zonegran was increased from 300mg to 400mg.  He
underwent an MRI with and without contrast, which showed a right
frontal hemorrhage and right sided subdural hematoma, which had
been observed on prior imaging.  He had no new lesions to
account for his increased seizure activity.

#Resp: The patient was intubated for airway protection in the
emergency department.  He was successfully extubated on [**4-1**].

#CV: The patient was noted to have a slightly elevated troponin
of 0.06 on admission, but with a normal CK-MB.  This quickly
decreased to 0.02, and was thought to be a slight troponin leak
in the context of prolonged seizure activity.

#ID: He was febrile on admission, and was initially started on
empiric antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and
acyclovir.  He underwent a lumbar puncture which had 1WBC,
2RBCs, elevated protein of 52, and a glucose of 90.  He had a
negative U/A and chest x-ray.  Antibiotics were discontinued.

The patient did well and was brought out to the floor.  He did
not have any new events on EEG.  He was determined to be ready
for discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for an extended seizure.  It
is not clear how long the seizure lasted.  You had recieved a
lot of anti-seizure medication and you were intubated to protect
your airway.  As you had a fever there was a concern that you
were infected and you were started on empiric antibiotics.  You
had a normal infectious workup, a normal lumbar puncture, chest
xray and normal urine and blood cultures.  Your MRI showed the
previous findings of the right frontal hemorrhage and right
sided subdural hematoma.  You were extubated without
complication and brought to the floor where you did well with no
further seizures.  To prevent further seizures your Zonegran was
increased to 400mg daily.  You did not have any further seizures

Medications were changed as follows:
Zonegran increased to 400mg qhs

Please make all follow up appointments.  Please take all
medications as prescribed.  If you experience any prolonged
seizures or any worsening of the symptoms listed below please
call your doctor or return to the nearest emergency room.

Chief Complaint:
Pleuritic chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Heimlich valve at [**Hospital3 3765**] for PTX

History of Present Illness:
85M with a PMh s/f severe COPD on chronic O2, complete heart
block s/p PMP [**7-21**], PVD s/p bilateral carotid endarterectomies
in [**2111**], HTN, HLD presents to presented to [**Hospital3 7569**]
w/chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath since
the AM. He had a recent hospitalization for MI and PNA, and had
completed a 2 week course of PNA on Sunday. At home, he denied
any F, C, N/V, but endorsed pleureitic L sided chest pain and
shortness of breath.
.
He initally was taken to [**Hospital3 **], and was given nitro
gtt, briefly was on a heparin gtt, and was given Levofloxacin
for a worsening LLL PNA. The plan was then to transfer to [**Hospital1 **]
since this is where he receives his cardiology care, for sats
70's-80's on facemask prior to switching to nrb, then improved
to low 90s for a cards evalulation. While he was in the
ambulance, radiology at [**Location (un) **] stat notified our ED of a
finding of a 30% left PTX. The ambulance was thus directed to
the nearest hospital, which turned out to be [**Hospital1 **]. At
[**Hospital1 **], his left PTX was relieved with a Heimlich valve device,
which on our repeat CXR shows resolution. The patient then
reported improved SOB, but still some mild L CP with
inspiration.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  99.0 110 170/91 20 98% cont neb
.
Labs were notable for HCT 36.2, INR 1.4.
.
He was given Aspirin 325mg, and 4 mg Morphine Sulfate.
.
CXR was notable for interval resolution of the PTX.
  .
On arrival to the MICU, he is AAOx3, surrounded by his family,
and comfortable. His family says that he had a slightly worse
cough,a lthough he has a chronic cough at baseline, although he
denies his cough is any worse.

CXR [**2-26**]:
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, raises
concern for an infection/pneumonia and/or aspiration. Blunting
of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a small pleural
effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis.

A tubular structure/catheter extending into the left lung apex
with possible tiny left apical pneumothorax remaining. However,
suggest followup with removal of external artifact for better
evaluation. Upright PA and lateral views may be helpful for
further evaluation when/if patient able.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2120-2-28**]
The left pigtail is in place. The left lower lobe consolidation
has
substantially improved. Heart size and mediastinum are overall
unchanged.
The assessment of the lung bases still demonstrate bilateral
pleural effusion, small on the right and most likely small to
moderate on the left.



Brief Hospital Course:
85M with a PMh s/f severe COPD on chronic O2, complete heart
block s/p PMP [**7-21**], PVD s/p bilateral carotid endarterectomies
in [**2111**], HTN, HLD presents with pleuritic pain and found to have
a L PTX.

# PTX/Chest Pain: Has remained hemodynamically stable since
arrival to the hosptial. Has a Heimlich valve device in place,
and is oxygenating well, without new development of PTX. Most
likely the pt developed a PTX from the bursting of a bleb as a
complication of severe COPD. The pt was ruled out for an MI with
CE. He was weaned down to 2L of O2 NC which is his home O2
requirement. Interventional pulmonology removed the Heimlich
valve without complication.
.
# LLL infiltrate: CXR this hospitalization shows a LLL opacity.
The pt just completed a two week course of antibiotics
prescribed by his PCP for treatment of pneumonia. The pt was
afebrile, without a leukocytosis and cough. There was no
evidence of infection currently and most likely this
radiographic reminence from resolving prior pneumonia. No
further antibiotics were given during this hospitalization.
.
# Acute Urinary Retention: The pt has known BPH and is on
Terazosin at home. He claims that for prior hospitalizations he
has required urinary catheterization for obstruction as well. He
was having difficulty voiding during this hospitalization. A
bladder scan revealed >1L of urine in his bladder. A foley
catheter was placed to relieve this obstruction. It was then
removed and a repeat voiding trial was obtained which showed him
to be retaining 600cc of urine in his bladder. A foley catheter
was re-inserted and a follow up appointment was made with
Urology for removal. We increased his dose of Terazosin from 2mg
to 5mg daily prior to discharge.

History of Present Illness:
80-year-old
female who underwent an open cholecystectomy that was
complicated by development of a complete transection of the
common bile duct. At the time, the injury was recognized
intraoperatively and the distal bile duct was tied off as
well as the proximal bile duct and a T tube was placed in the
proximal portion of the biliary tree in communication with
the liver. The patient was allowed to recover from this
surgery and was in the process of being referred for
definitive evaluation when she presented with a malpositioned
T tube and abdominal pain. She was sent to our facility for
further evaluation.  She underwent complete work-up including
placement of a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram in the
distal bile duct and now presents for definitive repair.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to Surgical service for management of CBD
injury.  Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram demonstrated
dilated intrahepatic biliary duct and obstructed common hepatic
duct with contrast extravasation into a contained collection.
No opacification of common bile duct.  An 8 French external
drainage catheter was placed and connected with a bag.  She was
started on vanco, levo and flagyl. Blood cultures on admission
grew pan-sensitive ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS.  She received IV
levaquin and po linezolid. A cardiac echo was done that did not
demonstrated vegetations. Pt was managed conservatively until
operation. She remained in the hospital until surgery.
Cardiology was consultation for preop eval. A p-mibi stress test
was done. Recommendations included improved bp control for which
lopresor was increased and norvasc was started. ASA was
recommended as well as reinstituting zocor.
CT A/P
1. Interval improvement in intrahepatic biliary dilatation,
status post catheter placement.
2. Significant improvement in perihepatic inflammatory process
centered in the hepatic flexure region.
3. Imaging findings are at least concerning for transection of
common bile duct.
.
P MIBI: Normal myocardial perfusion. Normal left ventricular
cavity size and
systolic function.
.
Echo:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
.
Pre-Op CXR:
Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is slightly more
severe consistent with mild cardiomegaly and/or pericardial
effusion. There is no pulmonary edema or congestion of vessels
in the lung or mediastinum to indicate clinically significant
cardiac decompensation. New linear opacities in the left lower
lung are due to atelectasis. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is
no pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy. Thoracic
aorta particularly at the arch, shows calcification but no
dilatation.
.
On [**2120-4-9**] she was taken to the OR by Dr.[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for
exploratory laparotomy, Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. She was
in satisfactory condition and was kept in the PACU for low UOP.
Pt was moved to the floor and low UOP continued.  Pt was moved
to the SICU for closer hemodynamic monitoring (eg CVP) for
post-op hypovolemia.  Pt was awake and oriented throughout.  Pt
was transfused one unit pRBC.  Pt responded to fluid boluses and
UOP improved.
POD 3 pt was moved back to the medical-surgical unit.  Diet was
started, and supplements added.  She complained on persistent
nausea, no appetite and vomiting after eating. Metformin, actos
and glyburide were held for possibility etiology of nausea,
vomiting and fluid retention. Insulin sliding scale was used and
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained.  An EGD was performed that
demonstrated gastritis. Zantac was d/c'd and protonix was
increased to [**Hospital1 **] and maalox was administered with improvement in
appetite and dietary tolerance. Actos and glyburide were
restarted POD 5 pt had cholangiogram: contrast in the common
hepatic duct, right and left hepatic ducts and multiple
intrahepatic divisions as well as contrast in the jejunum. No
obstruction or stricture identified. No extraluminal contrast.

An abdominal CT was done on [**2120-4-18**] that demonstrated the
following:  Stable appearance of the perihepatic inflammatory
process, involving the surgical bed, hepatic flexure, and
omentum. No organized abscess/fluid collection.
2) Interval decrease in size in the small fluid collection
adjacent to the pancreatic tail.
3) No evidence of bowel obstruction.
4) Right adrenal adenoma.
5) Probable tiny left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.

She required increased lopressor, hctz and ntg tp for bp control
for sbp's in range of 170/80-160/70. BP decreased on these meds
to range of 127/70. She was discharged home in stable condition,
tolerating a regular diet and ambulating independently.

[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

Reportedly, her C2 fracture is stable and the surgeons there
only wanted to immobilize it until her hip could be addressed.
.
Pt had a cardiology consult in [**State 108**], she had a CHF
exacerbation with a BNP of 15,000. Her Toprol XL was increased
from 37.5 to 50 mg PO qd with a plan to increase to 100 mg po
QD.  She was started on digoixin.  Her lasix was increased.
.
Of note, transfer paperwork notes that the pt was seen by PCP in
[**Name9 (PRE) 108**] for exertional CP and SOB relieved by NTG in [**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2143**].  At that time her Imdur was increased from 30 to 60 mg PO
qd.
.
Before her hospitalization she had been increasingly agitated
and had been started on Risperdal, which was recently d/c'd
after she became increasingly confused.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o dementia, CAD, diastolic CHF (EF 55%), severe
AS, chronic afib, transferred from OSH with R hip fracture and
possible C2 fracture for operative management of hip. She was
stable on the floor on her initial arrival.  Given her CHF and
AS, she was a high risk surgical candidate, but the family
decided to go ahead with the operation.  Postoperatively she was
in the MICU briefly for hypotension but was extubated without
difficulty, weaned off pressors after rehydration and
transferred back to the floor.  Perioperatively, she developed a
UTI and a LIJ clot, which were both treated.  Postoperatively,
she also developed delirium, and was less verbal than she was
previously.  She failed a speech and swallow evaluation, but the
medical team was optomistic that she would improve.  In the
meantime, multiple attempts at NGT placement were unsuccessful.

While on the floor, [**3-14**]-30, patient showed signs of
inability to clear her secretions.  On [**3-15**], she had an episode
of hypoxia.  CXR at that time revealed fluid overload, and she
seemed to improve with lasix.  Overnight that night, 1/2 blood
culture bottles were positive for S.aureus and Vancomycin was
started.  [**3-16**], she continued to do poorly, and again was
hypoxic.  CXR this time revealed dry lungs, but likely
aspiriation PNA or LUL.  Despite aggressive suctioning and
broadening of antibiotic coverage, Mrs. [**Known lastname 65362**] continued to
deteriorate and ultimately died approx 4:25 PM on [**3-16**].

US [**3-13**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. Morphology of the liver is consistent with cirrhosis. Of
note, there is
partial clot within the main and right portal veins, with flow,
therefore this is non-occlusive. This does, however had the
appearance of recanalization. Additionally, there is no flow
within the posterior branch of the right portalvein which is
completely occluded with echogenic clot. The flow within the
main portal vein, left portal vein and anterior branch of the
right portalvein is hepatopetal.

2. Trace ascites, varices and splenomegaly, findings consistent
with portal
hypertension.

3. Hypodense lesion within the periphery of the spleen may
represent an
infarct, especially in the setting of clot within the portal
venous system.
However, other diagnostic considerations include a focal
hematoma in the
appropriate clinical setting of trauma. Of note, there is no
flow within thesplenic lesion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52 yo woman with cirrhosis secondary to PBC and
autoimmune hepatitis who presented from home after routine labs
showed INR of 5.3. INR was 7.0 on admission. It did decrease
some with IV vitamin K. During her admission, a liver donor
became available and she accepted the donor liver offer. On
[**2193-3-15**], she underwent liver [**Date Range **] with aortic conduit.
Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**]. Induction immunosuppression was given
(solumedrol and cellept). Please refer to operative notes for
further details. She was sent to the SICU immediately postop for
care. LFTs increased immediately postop, but trended down each
day. A liver duplex demonstrated patent vessels. Medial and
lateral JPs were non-bilious. She was extubated o [**3-16**] and
transferred out of the SICU after 3 days on [**3-17**].

Diet was slowly advanced and she was able to take in 1600
kcals/58 grams protein. She was assisted to get oob to ambulate
wearing her TLSO brace for known thoracic and lumbar compression
fractures. The medial JP was removed on [**3-20**] with a daily output
of 130cc. The lateral JP output remained high  (1500 cc) and
serum sodium was low (down to 126)requiring IV saline fluid
replacements and albumin. This continued for several more days.
Serum sodium normalized and JP output decreased to 500cc/day by
postop day 12 ([**3-27**]). At this point, the lateral jp was removed
and site sutured. This site as well as the incision remained
dry.

She did well with medication teaching and insulin sliding scale
injection (due to hyperglycemia from steroids). An interpreter
was present for these sessions. Immunosuppression consisted of
cellcept 1gram [**Hospital1 **] that was well tolerated. Steroids were
tapered to 20mg daily and prograf was adjusted by trough levels.
Discharge dose was 3mg [**Hospital1 **].

She was discharged with low dose lasix daily for 2 + lower leg
edema to knees. VNA services were arranged for nursing, PT and
evaluation of home health services.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] is a former 936
gram product of a 26 and [**3-8**] week gestation, twin pregnancy,
born to a 45 year old, Gravida II, now Para II woman.

PRENATAL SCREENS:  Blood type 0 negative, antibody negative,
Rubella immune; rapid plasma reagent nonreactive; hepatitis B
surface antigen negative; hepatitis C negative; HIV negative,
group beta strep status unknown.

The maternal pregnancy was notable for hypothyroidism on
Synthroid, ureteral reflux, status post repair; fibroids,
status post resection and HSV with last lesion in [**2148-9-2**].  This was an in-[**Last Name (un) 5153**] fertilization pregnancy with
donor eggs.  The donor was 26 years old.  The pregnancy was
remarkable for dichorionic, diamniotic twins with concordant
growth.  Cervical shortening diagnosed at 21 weeks, treated
with bed rest at home and then admitted on [**9-17**].  The
mother was beta complete as of [**9-20**].  There was
premature labor treated with Terbutaline and then magnesium
on [**9-21**].  There was a questionable premature rupture
of membranes on [**9-21**].  On the date of delivery, the
mother was noted to have advanced cervical dilatation with
breech/breech presentation.  Intrapartum antibiotics were
given and the mother received a cesarean section under spinal
anesthesia.

Twin 1 emerged with initial cry but then poor respiratory
effort, requiring bagged mask ventilation.  He was intubated
in the delivery room.  Apgar scores were six at one minute
and seven at five minutes.  The child was brought to the
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination was notable for a
premature male, orally intubated with poor perfusion.  Birth
weight was 936 grams, which was the 50th percentile; length
was 35.5 cm (50th percentile); head circumference 24.5 cm (50
percentile).  The infant is a non dysmorphic male with
overall appearance consistent with gestational age.  The
anterior fontanel was soft, open and flat.  Palate intact.
Fair aeration with crackly breath sounds, no murmur, a soft
abdomen.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  1+ pulses throughout.
Normal male genitalia with the testes high in the canal, a
patent anus, no sacral dimple, no hip click; mild bruising on
the arms and a 1.5 by 5 cm birth mark/versus bruise in the
back mid thoracic region.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.) Respiratory:  The patient was initially
intubated on settings of 20/5 at a rate of 25.  He received
three doses of Surfactant.  On day of life #3, he was weaned
to C-pap of 6 cm on room air. He was also started on caffeine
on day of life three. He weaned from C-pap to room air on day
of life #20. He remained on caffeine with mild apnea of
prematurity.  The caffeine was discontinued on day of life
45. He has remained apnea free and, at the time of discharge,
he is breathing comfortably on room air with good
saturations, with no evidence of apnea of prematurity for
over two weeks.

2.) Cardiovascular:  He initially required two normal saline
boluses and was started on Dopamine. He was weaned off
Dopamine on day of life number two. He continued to have
stable blood pressures.  He never had a patent ductus
arteriosus.  At the time of discharge, he has stable blood
pressures with good perfusion.

3.) Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The infant was
initially made n.p.o. and was started on intravenous
nutrition.  Feeds were started on day of life 6 and gradually
advanced.  He reached full feeds on day of life 13 and
calories were gradually increased to a maximum of 30 calories
per ounce.  His growth continued to be good and he started
orally feeding.  At the time of discharge, he was tolerating
full feeds of breast milk for Enfamil supplement at 24
calories per ounce.  His discharge weight is 3.525 kg.

4.) Gastrointestinal:  The infant developed unconjugated
hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity and was treated with
phototherapy from day of life #1 through day of life #8.  His
maximum total bilirubin level was 4.9 over 0.3 on day of life
number one.

5.) Hematology:  The infant did receive one blood transfusion
on day of life #12 for a low hematocrit.

6.) Infectious disease:  Initial complete blood count showed
neutropenia as subsequent CBC on day of life one had an
impressive left shift. He was started on Ampicillin and
Gentamycin on day of life one and completed a 7 day course.
All cultures remained negative.  A lumbar puncture was
performed on day of life number four which revealed zero red
blood cells and three white blood cells.  Cultures in the
spinal fluid were also negative.

At the time of discharge, the patient has remained off
antibiotics with negative cultures.

7.) Neurology:  Head ultrasounds were performed on day of
life number 3, day of life number 10 and day of life number
31. All head ultrasounds remained within normal limits.

8.) Ophthalmology:  Ophthalmology examination was performed
on [**11-18**] and Mid- [**Month (only) 1096**] and revealed immaturity
bilaterally in zone three.  Follow-up ophthalmology is
required.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home.

PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 50100**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10132**] at [**Hospital 3146**] Pediatrics.

Service:  NEUROSURGICAL

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76-year-old man
brought into [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department after an
unwitnessed syncopal episode.  The patient recalled going for
a walk in the afternoon and then no memory of events until he
was brought to the Emergency Room on [**2113-8-19**].  He was
reportedly found down by bystanders on the sidewalk
""confused"".  EMS was called and they found the patient alert
with stable vital signs, unremarkable exam and no complaints.
In the Emergency Department, exam was remarkable only for
systolic murmur which was old.  Electrocardiograms were
unchanged from prior.  A head CT with and without contrast,
however, revealed a large left frontal parietal mass presumed
to be metastases given his history of small cell lung cancer.
He was given then Dilantin 300 mg p.o. and Solu-Medrol 85 mg
intravenous.  He initially presented with the right lower
lobe lung nodule in [**2112-7-26**] and a cough with weight
loss.  In addition, he had postobstructive pneumonia.  A
bronchoscopic biopsy revealed small cell lung cancer.  Bone
scan and head CT in [**2112-8-26**] were negative.  He was
billed as a limited stage and underwent four cycles of
carboplatin and etoposide between [**2112-9-25**] and [**2112-12-26**], resulting in resolution by radiologic studies at least
of his mass.  Subsequent surveillance chest x-rays every
three months have all been negative.  The last one was on
[**8-9**].

respirations 17, 97% on room air.
GENERAL:  He is a pleasant man in no acute distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Mucous membranes moist, anicteric.  No evidence
of tongue laceration.
NECK:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruits.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur
in the left upper sternal border.
CHEST:  Clear bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds, no palpable hepatosplenomegaly.  He was guaiac
negative.
EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented to person, place, but not
time.  He said it was [**2114-6-25**].  Motor [**3-30**] extensors, left
upper extremity wrist [**4-29**], otherwise.  Light touch was
grossly intact.  Cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact
with a left homonymous hemianopsia which is old.  Finger to
nose, heel to shin slow but intact.  No pronator drift.  Deep
tendon reflexes were symmetric and toes were downgoing
bilaterally.

LABORATORIES AND IMAGING:  White count 4.5, hematocrit 37,
platelet count 133.  His chem-7 was significant for a
creatinine of 1.7.  His baseline is between 1.2 and 1.6.
Electrocardiogram was not changed from prior and a head CT on
admission showed a 4.1 x 3.7 cm enhancing mass in the left
frontal lobe extending to the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left
ventricle with effacement of sulci on the right consistent
with metastatic disease, new since the [**12-26**] exam.  In
addition, a chronic right occipital infarct which is
unchanged.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the O-Med
service.  He was ruled out by CKs, continued on aspirin and
beta blockers.  In addition, he was started on intravenous
steroids and put on seizure precautions, as well as given
Dilantin.  The patient, in addition, his p.o. intake was
encouraged and his creatinine returned to baseline.  In
conjunction with his oncologist, neurosurgery was consulted
in addition radiation oncology was consulted, as well.  The
patient underwent work up to determine extent of his
metastatic disease, including an MRI of his head which was
again consistent with metastatic disease as well as a CT of
his lung, abdomen and pelvis, which showed no metastatic
disease in the abdomen or pelvis.  No liver lesions, adrenal
lesions, however his lung mass appeared to have increased in
size.

In conjunction with oncology, radiation oncology and
neurosurgery, it was decided that the patient would go for
resection of the brain metastasis.  He was transferred to the
neurosurgical service on [**2113-8-24**] and underwent craniotomy on
[**2113-8-24**] with resection of the left frontal brain lesion.
Surgery proceeded without any complications.  A surgical
drain was put in which was left there and the drain was
pulled [**2113-8-26**].  The patient continued to do well and
transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the floor where
he remained stable neurologically.  At that time, the patient
remained alert and awake, arousable, oriented to person with
good strength in all extremities, no pronator drift, looking
in all directions.  On the floor, had some problems with
[**Name2 (NI) **] pressure control.  His Toprol was changed to Lopressor
75 t.i.d., did well with that.  He was seen by physical
therapy and the plan was to discharge this patient with
inpatient rehabilitation.

Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old
female who originally presented with a persistent cough.  At
the time, a chest x-ray was performed, which showed an
abnormal mediastinum.  A suspicion was raised about a
possible ascending aortic aneurysm.  A follow-up CT scan was
performed, which showed a 5.2 x 5.4 cm in diameter aneurysm
that appeared to taper at the level of the innominate artery.
The patient's echocardiogram showed good left ventricular
function with mild left ventricular hypertrophy.  In
addition, the patient was noted to have a moderately dilated
aortic root and 2+ aortic insufficiency with mild aortic
stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation.
In addition, the patient underwent cardiac catheterization
preoperatively, which showed two vessel disease with disease
in the left anterior descending artery, first diagonal, and a
large obtuse marginal.  The patient presented to Cardiac
Surgery for a possible surgical intervention.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease
2.  Hypertension
3.  Peptic ulcer disease
4.  Depression
5.  Valvular disease

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Zestril 40 mg by mouth once daily
2.  Imipramine 100 mg once daily
3.  Trazodone 100 mg daily at bedtime
4.  Atenolol 25 mg once daily
5.  Nexium as needed

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 30.8, white blood cell count
9.1, platelets 72.  Glucose 110, BUN 23, creatinine 1.4,
sodium 137, potassium 4.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Surgery service.  Given the history of ascending aortic
aneurysm and coronary artery disease, the patient underwent:
1.  Resection and repair of ascending aortic and proximal
aortic arch aneurysm
2.  Coronary artery bypass graft x 1
3.  Aortic valve replacement

The patient tolerated the procedure well, which was performed
on [**2200-9-5**].  There were no complications.  The resection and
repair of the ascending and proximal arch aortic aneurysm was
performed with hemi-arch-type repair using 26 mm gel-weave
Dacron tube graft.  The aortic valve replacement was done
with a 21 [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial bioprosthesis.  The
patient remained intubated and was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.

She remained intubated.  The patient was diuresed
appropriately.  The patient was started on several
medications to maintain her systolic blood pressure at 120 or
below.

On postoperative day one, the patient was noted to have
decreased bowel sounds and dark-colored drainage from the
mouth.  Vancomycin and levofloxacin were added empirically.
The patient was continued on nitro drip to help maintain her
pressures.  She was also continued on Lopressor and
Hydralazine, as well as labetalol.

The patient was extubated on [**2200-9-9**].  She tolerated
extubation well, without any complications.  The patient was
noted to have periods of confusion.  Of note is that the
patient had to go back to the operating room for a chest
evacuation of a hematoma and suturing of a bleeding vessel.
Cardiology was consulted to assist with blood pressure
control.  Cardiology recommendation was to initiate more
aggressive diuresis, to continue labetalol, Captopril and
Hydralazine.  Her antidepressant medication (imipramine) was
discontinued.

The patient was transferred to the regular floor in stable
condition.  On [**2200-9-14**], the patient appeared to be in
increased respiratory distress.  She had crackles on
examination bilaterally.  She was thought to be fluid
overloaded.  A chest x-ray done at the time showed bilateral
pleural effusions, left significantly greater than right,
with associated left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.  The
patient was diuresed more.  An electrocardiogram was
obtained, which showed no change.  In addition, left
thoracentesis was performed, with significant amount of fluid
drained.  In addition, a pigtail catheter was placed by
bedside and fluid was drained with suction.

A follow-up chest x-ray obtained on the following day showed
significant improvement in the amount of fluid present in the
lungs.  Consequently, the pigtail catheter was removed on
[**2200-9-17**].

The other issue was the patient's decreased appetite, which
has been going on for the last week or so.  The patient was
restarted on her outpatient dose of imipramine.  She was
encouraged to eat and also to ambulate.  Physical Therapy was
following her during the hospitalization course.  The patient
remained afebrile.  She was improving her oxygenation.

The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility in
stable condition.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Ascending aortic aneurysm status post resection and
repair of the ascending aortic and proximal aortic arch
aneurysm
2.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft x 1
3.  Aortic valve replacement
4.  Hypertension
5.  Depression

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 1071**]-[**Known lastname 29608**] is a former
961 gram product of a 31-5/7 week gestation pregnancy born to
a 28-year-old G1, P0, woman.  Prenatal screens:  Blood type O
positive, antibody negative, RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune,
hepatitis B surface antigen negative, Group beta Strep status
unknown.  Estimated date of confinement was [**2156-9-17**],
based on last menstrual period and first trimester
ultrasound.  The pregnancy was uncomplicated until [**2156-7-6**], when there was intrauterine growth restriction noted on
fetal ultrasound.  There was extensive laboratory evaluation
and workup and no etiology for the growth restriction was
identified.  She was followed closely with fetal biophysical
profiles [**9-3**] and normal amniotic fluid volume then.  On the
day of delivery her amniotic fluid volume dropped and the
fetus was noted to have two heart rate decelerations.  She
underwent elective induction but was taken to cesarean
section for concern for fetal distress.  The infant emerged
with spontaneous cry, required blow-by oxygen, had Apgars of
8 at one minute and 8 at five minutes.  She was transferred
to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for treatment of
prematurity.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE
UNIT:  Weight 961 grams, less than 10th percentile.  Length
38 cm, 58th percentile.  Head circumference 25.5 cm, less
than 10th percentile.  General:  Nondysmorphic,
well-appearing, pre-term infant.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat:  Anterior fontanelle soft and level.  Red reflex
present bilaterally.  Palate intact.  Symmetric facial
features.  Chest:  Breath sounds clear and equal.  Minimal
retractions.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm
without murmur.  Two plus peripheral pulses including
femoral.  Abdomen benign without hepatosplenomegaly.  Small
umbilical cord noted.  Genitourinary:  Normal female external
genitalia consistent with gestational age.  Spine normal with
normal sacrum.  Hips stable.  Skin pink with brisk capillary
refill.  Neuro:  Normal tone and responsiveness.  Alert and
in no acute distress.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY
DATA:
1.  Respiratory:  The retractions and tachypnea noted upon
admission resolved within the first eight hours of life.
[**Known lastname **] always remained in room air throughout her Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit admission.  She had infrequent episodes
of apnea and bradycardia, the last occurring on [**2156-8-9**].

2.  Cardiovascular:  [**Known lastname **] has maintained normal heart
rates and blood pressures during admission.  A soft murmur
has been noted intermittently and remains audible at the time
of discharge.  It is felt to be consistent with peripheral
pulmonic stenosis and benign in nature.

3.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  Initial glucose was
45.  [**Known lastname **] required several dextrose boluses for
hypoglycemia which resolved within 24 hours of birth.  She
was initially NPO and maintained on intravenous fluids.
Parenteral feeds were started on day of life number two and
gradually advanced to full volume.  Her maximum caloric
intake was 30 calories per ounce.  She is currently taking
150/cc/kg/day of breast milk or Enfamil fortified to 26
calories per ounce.  The formula is four calories by
concentration and two calories by corn oil and the breast
milk is four calories with Enfamil powder and two calories by
corn oil.  Serum electrolytes were checked in the first week
of life and were within normal limits.  Discharge weight is
1.875 kilograms which is 4 pounds, 2.1 ounces, a length of 47
cm and a head circumference of 30.5 cm.

4.  Infectious Disease:  Due to her prematurity, [**Known lastname **]
was evaluated for sepsis.  A white blood cell count was 7,900
with 33% polys, 0% bands.  A blood culture was obtained and
she was not treated with antibiotics.  The blood culture was
no growth at 48 hours.

5.  Hematological:  Initial hematocrit at birth was 66.3% and
platelets were 43,000.  [**Known lastname **] is blood type O positive
and is Coombs negative.  Platelet count fell to 24,000 on day
of life one and [**Known lastname **] was transfused with platelets and
also received intravenous gamma globulin.  On day of life
number four and again on day of life number seven she
required transfusion of platelets for counts less than
60,000.  On the day after her third platelet transfusion her
platelet count was 104,000 and within 72 hours it was
255,000.  A repeat count on day of life 17 was 694,000.  The
etiology of the thrombocytopenia was consistent with the
intrauterine growth restriction.  The platelet antibody was
sent on the mother and was negative.  [**Known lastname **] low
hematocrit occurred on [**2156-8-25**], at 22.1%.  Reticulocyte
count at that time was 7.9%.  A repeat hematocrit on [**2156-8-1**], was 25.7%.

6.  Gastrointestinal:  [**Known lastname **] required treatment for
unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.  Her peak
serum bilirubin occurred on day of life number one with a
total of 5.9 mg/dl.  She was treated with phototherapy for
approximately five days.  Her rebound bilirubin on day of
life nine was 2.6 total over 0.6 mg/dl direct.

7.  Endocrine:  A state screen sent on [**2156-8-5**], had a
thyroid stimulating hormone level of 45.7 with the reference
range being less than 15 microunits per mL.  An Endocrine
consult from [**Hospital3 1810**] was obtained.  Repeat
thyroid function tests showed a definite clinical
hypothyroidism and treatment with Synthroid was started on
[**2156-8-13**].  A significant part of the history was that the
mother was treating a wound dehiscence with Betadine packing
and it was theorized that the hypothyroidism may have been
induced by the infant's exposure to iodine through the
mother's milk.  The breast milk was held for one week and
then breast feeding re-initiated.  Thyroid function tests
have been followed weekly and have been slowly normalizing.
The most recent thyroid stimulating hormone was 9.1 down from
12 with a normal range of 0.27 to 4.2.  T3 was 167 up from
140 and the free T4 was 1.8 up from 1.4 with a normal range
of 0.93 to 1.7.  [**Known lastname **] is being discharged home on
Synthroid with Endocrine follow up in four weeks with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 51137**] at [**Hospital3 1810**], phone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 37116**].  Thyroid function tests will be checked again
at that time.

8.  Neurology:  Head ultrasounds were obtained on [**7-23**] and
[**2156-8-18**], and both studies were within normal limits.
There were no neurological concerns at the time of discharge.

9.  Sensory:  Audiology:  Hearing screening was performed
with automated auditory brainstem responses.  [**Known lastname **]
passed in both ears.  Ophthalmology:  The retinal examination
was performed on [**2156-8-12**], showing mature retinas
bilaterally.  Recommended follow up at eight months of age.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Home with parents.

There is an appointment scheduled for [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**9-6**] at
1:30 p.m.

RECOMMENDATIONS AT DISCHARGE:
1.  Feeding:  Enfamil 26 calorie per ounce at concentration
two by corn oil or expressed mother's milk fortified to 26
calories with four of Enfamil powder plus two of corn oil.
2.  Medications:  Ferrous sulfate 25 mg per mL dilution 0.3
cc p.o. q. day; levothyroxine 12.5 mcg p.o. q. day.
3.  Car seat position screening was performed.  The infant
was observed for 90 minutes without episodes of oxygen
desaturation or bradycardia.
4.  State newborn screens were sent on [**7-25**], [**8-4**] and
[**2156-8-21**].  Except for the hypothyroidism as previously
mentioned, the results were within normal limits.  The state
screen sent on [**2156-8-21**], showed a normal TSH and T4
level.
5.  No immunizations have been administered to date.  She did
not receive hepatitis B as she does not meet weight criteria
as yet.

IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED:
1.  Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**]
through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet any of the following three
criteria:  (1) Born at less than 32 weeks; (2) Born at 32 to
35 weeks and plan for day care during RSV season, with smoker
in the household or with preschool sibs or (3) With chronic
lung disease.
2.  influenza immunization should be considered annually in the
fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they
reach six months of age.  Before this age the family and other
care givers should be considered for immunization against

Imaging:
MRI/A Head Neck [**4-13**]:
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and
diffusion
axial images of the brain were acquired before gadolinium. T1
axial and MP-
RAGE sagittal images were obtained following gadolinium. 3D
time-of-flight
MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] obtained. Gadolinium-enhanced MRA of
the neck and fat-suppressed axial images of the neck were
acquired.
FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI:
Comparison was made with the previous MRI of [**2193-4-11**]. Since the
previous study, the patient has undergone resection of a large
meningioma in the right frontal region. Extensive right-sided
brain edema is again identified. There are blood products at the
surgical site. Although no
residual nodular enhancement is seen, there is enhancement seen
along the
sulci and meningeal enhancement identified in the region. These
findings
indicate both pachy and leptomeningeal enhancement. Mild slow
diffusion in
the surrounding area on diffusion images is indicative of
postoperative
change. There is blood in the left lateral ventricle. There is
persistent
mass effect on the right lateral ventricle. Changes of small
vessel disease
are seen. A left frontal drainage catheter is identified. Note
is made of new areas of slow diffusion in the right medial
thalamus. These findings are indicative of acute infarcts which
are new since the previous study.
Again noted is enhancing meningioma in the tuberculum sella
region.
Additionally, enhancement and flow void in the left medial
temporal lobe
region indicative of an aneurysm at the site of previously noted
arteriovenous malformation. Post-craniectomy changes are seen in
the right frontal region. Pneumocephalus identified.
IMPRESSION: Previous MRI examination, the patient has undergone
resection of a large frontal meningioma with blood products at
the surgical site without residual nodular enhancement.
Leptomeningeal and pachymeningeal enhancement is seen which
appears postoperative. Acute right-sided thalamic infarcts are
seen which are new since the previous study. Other findings are
stable as described above.
MRA OF THE NECK:
The neck MRA demonstrates normal flow in the carotid and
vertebral arteries. The fat-suppressed images demonstrate subtle
increased soft tissues adjacent to the proximal right common
carotid artery as seen on the CTA. This could be related to
small amount of blood in the surrounding soft tissues from
recent attempted central venous line placement. There is no
definite dissection seen.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the neck.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates no evidence of vascular occlusion or
stenosis. The previously seen aneurysm in relation with the left
posterior cerebral artery is not apparent on the MRA. The left
medial temporal lobe arteriovenous malformation is also not
clearly visualized.
IMPRESSION: No vascular occlusion or stenosis seen on the MRA of
the head.
Postoperative changes are noted following removal of frontal
lobe tumor.
Acute right thalamic infarcts are identified. MRA of the neck is
normal
without dissection. MRA of the head demonstrates no stenosis or
occlusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was electively admitted on [**4-11**] to undergo resection of
his brain mass. Post-operatively, he was transferred to the ICU
for continuous monitoring.  During his perioperative course,
central line placement was complicated by access to the carotid
artery.  Post-op, vascular surgery was consulted, duplex studies
performed, and determined to be without injury to the carotid
artery. MRI/A was also done to further confirm this as well as
evaluate surgical resection. The vascular surgery team agreed
that there was no carotid artery dissection and no intervention
needed on their part.

The patient was extubated in the ICU and was then transferred to
the floor. He did well over the weekend. The patient was able to
eat without difficulty. PT and OT evaluated him and recommended
rehab placement. On [**4-16**] the patient was noted to have bloody
urine in the foley. A urinalysis revealed a UTI. He was started
on a 14-day course of cipro. The patient was sent to rehab on
[**4-16**].

[**2145-5-7**]: CT abdomen/pelvis
Large, [**Hospital1 **]-lobed ventral hernia contains multiple small bowel
loops.  There is evidence of incarceration, with mesenteric
kinking and multiple areas of abrupt narrowing at the entry and
exit points of the hernia.  Loops within and proximal to the
hernia are dilated up to 5-6 cm, with air-fluid levels. Several
regions of circumferential wall thickening, mucosal hyperemia,
and surrounding fluid raise concern for ischemia.  There is no
pneumatosis, pneumoperitoneum, or portal/mesenteric venous gas.

[**2145-5-8**] KUB:
Within this limitation, dilated small bowel loops in the left
lower quadrant are noted, likely representing the dilated
obstructive loop of bowel present in prior study.  NG tube tip
is in the stomach.

[**2145-5-18**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation with possible left anterior
fascicular
block. Borderline voltage criteria for left ventricular
hypertrophy. Modest ST-T wave changes that are non-specific.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2145-5-14**] ventricular
premature contraction is absent. Otherwise, no other significant
diagnostic change

[**2145-5-19**] CXR (AP):
Mild pulmonary edema with small to moderate bilateral pleural
effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 44910**] was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery service on
[**2145-5-7**] for management of her abdominal pain secondary to a
small bowel obstruction/incarcerated ventral hernia. Given the
large size of her [**Hospital1 **]-lobed ventral hernia, in addition to Ms.
[**Known lastname 44911**] poor surgical candidacy, she was treated
conservatively via bowel rest, IVF, and nasogastric
decompression via NGT. Her labs, most notably, her lactate and
WBC were trended throughout her hospital stay and were noted to
be within normal limits. Ms. [**Known lastname 44910**] gradually responded well to
this treatment, and was noted to be much less distended and
tender to palpation by HD#2. She self-dc'ed her NGT overnight on
HD#2 without worsening of her symptoms. On HD#3, her abdominal
exam remained improving, and she was given a bowel regimen to
which she responded well. On [**5-11**], the patient was advanced to
clears but did not tolerate that well and was again made NPO.
Because of concern for increasing abdominal pain and worsening
SBO, the patient was taken to the OR for an exploratory
laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, and small bowel resection with
primary anastomosis. See operative note for details. Her skin
and subcutaneous tissue were closed. She was transferred to the
TSICU post-op.

ICU course:

Neuro: The patient remained sedated while intubated. Once
sedation was weaned, she responded appropriately in terms of
mental status. Her pain was controlled.

CV/Pulm: Her cardiovascular status was stable and she was
continued on b-blockers while in the ICU. She has a history of
congestive heart failure and her volume status was monitored
closely. She was edematous and diuresed with lasix [**Hospital1 **]. Her IVFs
were discontinued as well in order to improve her edema, and
instead albumin was given. She remained intubated post-op and
was able to be weaned and extubated on [**5-15**].

GI: Post-op, she had an NGT in place and was NPO. Her NGT was
removed on [**5-16**] and she was advanced to sips on [**5-17**]. Her
abdominal wound was covered with dry sterile dressing and an
abdominal binder was kept on at all times. Her incision remained
c/d/i.

GU: She had a foley in place. She had intermitent episodes of
low UOP and was bolused gently as needed, with goal of 15-20
cc/hr of urine.

Heme: Her hematocrit remained stable throughout her ICU course

ID: she was given clotrimazole cream for a fungal infection

Prophy: She received subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
She was also continued on a H2 blocker.

Dispo: she was stable and ready for transfer to the floor on
[**2145-5-17**].

Once transferred to the surgical floor, Mrs.[**Known lastname 44912**] course by
system is as follows:

Neuro:  She's been oriented x 3 including the reason for her
admission.  Her pain has been treated with tramadol and
oxycodone PRN.  She has intermittent minor pain as expected
post-operatively.

Cardio:  Beta blockers have been continued.  She has been
hemodynamically stable with adequate rate control (70 - 90s).
Generalized edema 2 - 3+ persists.  Continue furosemide
treatment as discussed below.

The patient did describe chest pain (as translated by her
daughter) and shortness of breath on [**5-19**].  An ECG was obtained
and showed no acute changes when compared to prior tracings this
admission.  Troponin levels were drawn and were found to be
flat.  She has not described further chest pain after its
spontaneous resolution.

Pulm: A chest x-ray taken on [**5-18**] showed likely bilateral
pleural effusions.  She remains on supplemental oxygen via nasal
cannula.  She has described feeling short of breath at times.
Albuterol and atrovent nebulizer treatments have been
administered with good results.  Furosemide therapy is
continued.  With a fluid balance goal of 1 - 2 liters negative
per day, her dose was increased on [**5-19**] to 20mg PO BID.  Our
recommendation is to continue this dosing for approximately five
days and then decrease the dose back to her previous home dose
of 20mg PO daily.  Of course, further clinical exams are
warranted to determine effectiveness and titration of diuretic
therapy.

GI:  Mrs.[**Known lastname 44912**] abdominal incision has been
well-approximated with no signs of infection.  There have been
no issues of constipation or diarrhea.  She is tolerating a
mechanical soft, regular diet.

GU:  Daily fluid balances have been closely monitored due to
Mrs.[**Known lastname 44912**] history of congestive heart failure and current
(likely) bilateral pleural effusions.  She has diuresed well
from daily Lasix.  Her foley catheter was discontinued on [**5-19**].
She has since voided without issue, although frequently
incontinent.

Lines:  A right brachial PICC line was in place for prior IV
therapy.  The line was discontinued on [**5-19**].

Endocrine:  Although Mrs. [**Known lastname 44910**] is noted to have a history of
diabetes, her pre-prandial blood glucose levels have been well
controlled.  In general, she has not required an exogenous
insulin secondary to hyperglycemia while recouperating
post-operatively.  Per prior medical records, she not taking any
oral diabetic agents.

At this time, Mrs. [**Known lastname 44910**] is hemodynamically stable and ready
to be transferred to rehab.

uses a cane or walker at all times and he has a hospital bed
at home.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with coronary artery disease, brother
with coronary artery disease in his 50s.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile, heart rate
81, blood pressure 142/70, respiratory rate 25, oxygen
saturation 97% on five liters nasal cannula.  In general, the
patient is alert and oriented, slightly tachypneic.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat - The neck is supple.  The pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements are intact.  Cardiovascular is
irregularly irregular, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Respiratory - Crackles bilaterally at the bases.  The abdomen
is soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities - Dorsalis
pedis pulses are weakly palpable bilaterally, warm
extremities.  Neurologically, the patient is alert and
oriented.  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact
bilaterally.  Sensation is grossly intact bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 6.9, hematocrit
39.0, platelet count 160,000.  Sodium 141, potassium 4.0,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 24, blood urea nitrogen 14,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 188.  INR 1.4.  Digoxin level less
than 0.4.

Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation in the 70s,
right bundle branch block, inferior and anterior Q waves were
present.

Chest x-ray showed marked cardiomegaly without definite
evidence of congestive heart failure, no acute pulmonary
disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Non ST elevation myocardial infarction - The patient
underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed three vessel
coronary artery disease, elevated left and right sided
filling pressures with right ventricular end diastolic
pressure of 17, left ventricular filling pressures were also
elevated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 31.  The
patient had 40 to 50% left main stenosis, left anterior
descending artery was occluded at the origin.  The circumflex
had a 70% lesion with an occluded OM1 branch.  The right
coronary artery had a 90% proximal lesion.  Both saphenous
vein grafts to the posterior descending artery and the OM1
were widely patent.  The proximal ramus branch was
successfully stented.  The patient was placed on Aspirin and
Plavix.  In addition, his Metoprolol XL was titrated up to 75
mg once daily.  He was continued on his statin, his ace
inhibitor and his nitrate.  He will follow-up with his
outpatient cardiologist in one to two weeks.

2.  Congestive heart failure - The patient has an ejection
fraction of 20% and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure.  After his cardiac catheterization, the patient
developed mild pulmonary edema and increased shortness of
breath.  He was diuresed with additional intravenous Lasix
and a negative to even fluid balance was maintained
throughout the remainder of his hospital stay.  He was
continued on a two gram sodium diet and a fluid restriction
of 1.5 liters.  He was continued on his ace inhibitor and his
Toprol XL as well as his Digoxin and daily 40 mg of Lasix.

3.  Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia - The patient had
multiple short episodes of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia after his catheterization.  However, he also had
one episode of 50 minutes of nonsustained hemodynamically
stable ventricular tachycardia that spontaneously converted.
He was evaluated by electrophysiology cardiology and was
taken to the electrophysiology laboratory for ablation
therapy.  In addition, an ICD was placed and was programmed
to attempt to overdrive pace his ventricular tachycardia
multiple times before shocking as his nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia is asymptomatic.  On the day of
discharge, the patient was started on new antiarrhythmic,
Amiodarone.  He will take 400 mg p.o. daily of Amiodarone for
the first twenty-eight days and he will then be switched to
200 mg of Amiodarone daily.  AST and ALT were ordered upon
discharge and his liver function tests should be followed as
an outpatient.  In addition, the patient was instructed to
call and schedule pulmonary function tests within one week of
discharge.

4.  Atrial fibrillation - The patient has had chronic atrial
fibrillation.  His Coumadin was held for his
electrophysiology study and was restarted after his ICD was
placed.  He was given one dose of 5 mg q.h.s. and then was
started on new daily dose of 2 mg a day.  He will have his
INR checked within four to five days at the [**Hospital 197**] Clinic
at [**Hospital3 3583**] where this result will be called to his
primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient will have a follow-up
appointment at the Device Clinic on [**2161-9-18**].

5.  Hypothyroidism - The patient was continued on his
outpatient dose of Levoxyl throughout his admission.

6.  Hypertension - The patient's blood pressure was well
controlled at his increased dose of Metoprolol XL.
Spironolactone, Lasix, Captopril and Isosorbide Dinitrate
were continued at his admission doses.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 78 year old female with a
past medical history significant for obstructive sleep apnea,
pulmonary hypertension, chronic hypercapnic and hypoxemic
respiratory failure, who presented with worsening shortness
of breath and decreased oxygen saturation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year old
woman with a history of long-standing obstructive sleep apnea
and subsequent pulmonary hypertension.  Two days prior to
admission, the patient reported experiencing gradual
worsening shortness of breath.  On the morning of admission,
the patient's daughter found the patient severely short of
breath, cyanotic and called EMS.  When EMS arrived, the
patient was noted to have a room air oxygen saturation in the
60% range and she was noted to be tachypneic with a
respiratory rate in the 40s.

Upon arrival in the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department, the patient was noted to be cyanotic
and her vital signs showed a heart rate of 85, blood pressure
175/77, respiratory rate 32, and she was saturating at 97% on
100% nonrebreather face mask.  She denied any chest pain at
the time of Emergency Department presentation.  She denied
any [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 691**] fever or chills.  She denied any nausea or
vomiting.  There was no abdominal pain.  She denied any
urinary symptoms, and she denied any symptoms of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.

The patient was placed on full face mask BIPAP and was
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for monitoring of
her respiratory status.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Obstructive sleep apnea. This was diagnosed at least five
years prior to the time of admission when sleep studies
performed in [**2098-2-17**], showed 43 hypopneas and oxygen
saturation in the 70s.  This data was from records provided
by the patient's primary pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10132**], from [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center. At home, the patient wore CPAP
for four to six hours every night and received oxygen via
nasal cannula at a rate of 2 to 2.5 liters per minute during
the day.
2.  Chronic hypercapnic hypoxemic respiratory failure.  The
patient had room air oximetry studies performed in [**2102-7-21**], again at an outpatient hospital which showed that she
spent approximately 63% of her time with oxygen saturation in
the 90s, 24% of her time with oxygen saturation in the 80s
and 5% of her time with oxygen saturation in the 70s.
3.  Restrictive lung disease.
4.  Pulmonary hypertension.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
catheterization in [**2097-10-18**], which showed clean coronary
arteries.
7.  Status post inferior myocardial infarction approximately
fifteen years ago.
8.  Inguinal hernia.
9.  Chronic anemia thought to be due to Vitamin B12
deficiency.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lasix 40 mg q.d.
2.  Atenolol 25 mg once a day.
3.  Nitroglycerin patch 0.4 mg transdermal patch applied once
a day.
4.  Carvedilol 3.125 mg once a day.
5.  Allopurinol.

ALLERGIES:  Reported allergies were to Penicillin and
Streptomycin.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Not assessed.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a Russian speaking woman who
had come to the United States from [**Country 532**] eight years ago.
She lives alone in the [**Location (un) 86**] area but had two daughters who
lived nearby.  She had no history of tobacco use and no
history of exposure to asbestos or known industrial agents.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  When we examined the patient, her
vital signs revealed a heart rate of 48, blood pressure
89/48, respiratory rate 26, oxygen saturation 92% on BIPAP
face mask with a pressure support of 15, PEEP of 5 and FIO2
of 40%.  She was noted to be awake, alert and able to respond
to questions with the help of translation.  Her skin
examination was notable for pallor but no cyanosis.
Examination of the jugular venous distention revealed jugular
venous pulse of 9.0 centimeters.  Her chest examination
showed diffusely decreased breath sounds, decreased more so
on the left side than on the right side, however, there were
no wheezes or crackles noted.  Her cardiac examination
revealed a bradycardic heart rate but at a regular rhythm
with a harsh IV/VI systolic murmur heard across the
precordium, an occasional S3 but no rubs.  Her abdominal
examination revealed normoactive bowel sounds, obese but soft
abdomen, which was nontender.  There was no costovertebral
angle tenderness.  Examination of her extremities showed
dorsalis pedis pulses 1+ bilaterally.  Her extremities were
warm.  There was 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema.  She was
also noted to have bilateral calf tenderness.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, sodium 142, initial potassium
of 7.0 in a hemolyzed specimen with a repeat potassium of
4.9, chloride 96, bicarbonate 37, blood urea nitrogen 23,
creatinine 0.8, and glucose of 151.  Her complete blood count
revealed a white blood cell count of 6.9, hematocrit 37.5,
and platelet count of 357,000.  The white blood cell count
differential included 72% polys, 20 lymphocytes and 7
monocytes.  Her coagulation panel showed a prothrombin time
of 13.0, partial thromboplastin time of 29.1 and INR of 1.2.
Initial CK level was 65.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 78
beats per minute with some right axis deviation and right
bundle branch block which was unchanged from previous
electrocardiogram provided from outside hospital.

A chest x-ray showed opacification at the right mediastinal
border and prominent pulmonary vasculature but no focal
consolidation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department, an initial
arterial blood gas was performed with the patient on 100%
nonrebreather face mask.  This blood gas revealed a pH 7.19,
pCO2 122, and pO2 of 150.  After the patient was placed on a
face mask with 50% FIO2, a repeat blood gas showed a pH of
7.13, pCO2 of 137, and pO2 of 132.  The patient was given a
single dose of Levofloxacin in the Emergency Department to
treat for community acquired pneumonia.  She was also given
intravenous Solu-Medrol to treat for any underlying
bronchospastic component contributing to her pulmonary
decompensation.  She was given 1 mg of Morphine Sulfate and
also Nitroglycerin paste in the Emergency Department.

At the time of her Emergency Department presentation, the
patient reported a DNR/DNI code status.  Therefore,
intubation was not attempted in this patient.  Instead, full
face mask was the preferred method of oxygen delivery and she
was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
monitoring of her oxygenation and ventilatory status.

On the evening of admission, ultrasound studies of the lower
extremities were performed and revealed no evidence of deep
vein thrombosis.  The patient was also diuresed with Lasix,
having received a total of 100 mg intravenous Lasix in the
Emergency Department and an additional 40 mg of Lasix after
admission to the Intensive Care Unit.  This produced a net
diuresis of negative two liters on the evening of admission.
Further antibiotics were held at this time as the patient was
afebrile and did not have an elevated white blood cell count
and there was low clinical suspicion for pneumonia.  Further
steroids were also held.

Overnight, the patient's oxygenation and ventilatory status
improved somewhat based on repeat arterial blood gas
analysis.  She was placed on nasal CPAP overnight.  She
subsequently ruled out for myocardial infarction via cardiac
enzymes.

On [**2103-7-25**], hospital day two, an echocardiogram was obtained
in order to assess the possible role of diastolic congestive
heart failure contributing to pulmonary edema and the
patient's shortness of breath.  Following the echocardiogram
which was performed at the bedside, the patient experienced a
desaturation with oxygen saturation noted to be in the 30 to
40% range. The patient was noted to be profoundly cyanotic
and also began to report left sided chest pain.  An
electrocardiogram was obtained and showed no changes
suggestive of acute ischemia.  Stat portable chest x-ray also
showed no acute change from prior chest x-rays.

At the time of this desaturation event, the patient was on
nasal CPAP and ultimately after being placed on full face
mask BIPAP, the patient's oxygen saturation returned to the
80% range.  The echocardiogram ultimately showed an ejection
fraction greater than 55%, mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy.  Both the left atrium and the right atrium were
noted to be dilated.  There was an overall decrease in right
heart function and there was severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

Although previously obtained lower extremity ultrasounds had
revealed no deep vein thrombosis, we continued to entertain
the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.  From the time of her
Emergency Department presentation, the patient had been
unable to lie flat without becoming profoundly short of
breath.  Therefore, we had been unable to send the patient
for a CT angiogram study to prove the presence of pulmonary
embolism.  However, after this desaturation event, the
decision was made to empirically anticoagulate the patient
with Heparin.  Her Levofloxacin was also restarted to treat
for a presumptive pneumonia.

This same day an initial blood culture taken in the Emergency
Department returned positive for gram positive cocci in pairs
and clusters in one out of two bottles and the patient was
begun on Vancomycin.

The patient subsequently remained stable from a respiratory
standpoint but was noted to have intermittent bradycardia
with heart rates in the 30 or 40s which were transient and
were not associated with any hypotension. Atropine was placed
at the patient's bedside.

On the morning of [**2103-7-26**], the patient was restarted on
Solu-Medrol to treat for any possible underlying component of
bronchospastic disease and the decision was made to obtain a
bedside abdominal ultrasound to evaluate the question of a
pleural effusion at the right lung base seen on serial chest
x-rays.  However, before the ultrasound could be obtained,
the patient experienced another desaturation event early in
the afternoon on [**2103-7-26**].  This was accompanied by
bradycardia and eventually cardiopulmonary arrest and the
patient ultimately succumbed and was declared deceased on the
afternoon of [**2103-7-26**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11041**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2161-8-30**] for further
work-up of his fever. Blood cultures revealed MSSA bacteremia
and an infectious disease consult was obatined. Vancomycin and
gentamicin were started and an echo was performed. This revealed
acute endocarditis with new aortic regurgitation and a
paravalvular abscess. The cardiac surgery service was consulted
for surgical evaluation and Mr. [**Known lastname 11041**] was worked-up in the
usual preoperative manner. It was preferred to wait 4-6 weeks
prior to surgery given his active endocarditis. Given the length
of stay and his multiple medical issues, the remainder of the
discharge summary will be broken down into systems.

Renal:
The renal service continued to follow Mr. [**Known lastname 11041**] and manage his
hemodialysis. His electrolytes were repleted as needed.

Transplant:
Given his positive blood cultures and his history of multiple
line infections, the transplant service was consulted. His old
tunneled catheter was removed and a temporary internal jugular
line was placed.  The transplant service decided that he would
be best served with a more permenant catheter for upcoming
dialysis. On [**2161-9-9**], Mr. [**Known lastname 11041**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] removal of his right
internal jugular line and placement of a left internal jugular
PermaCath. He remained on the transplant surgery list. [**2161-9-30**]
an ultrasound was obtained as his lines were not flushing
easily. This revealed extensive thrombus in the right subclavian
vein with thrombus in the left subclavian vein at its junction
with the internal jugular. His lines were left in place with as
access was needed and some of the clot was extracted.

Dental:
A dental consult was obtained who recommended he have his wisdom
teeth removed prior to his valve surgery based on a physical
exam and x-rays. Clindamycin was prophylactically dosed for his
extraction. On [**2161-9-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname 11041**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] extraction of
three impacted third molar teeth and 3 impacted supernumerary
teeth without complication. He tolerated the procedure well
without complications. He had a slight fever two days following
his teeth extraction which delayed his surgery however his
fevers were not related to his extractions.

Infectious Disease:
Given his admission for endocarditis, the infectious disease
service was consulted for assistance in Mr. [**Known lastname 48504**]
management.  Based on cultures and the patients allergy to
penicillin, vancomycin was used. As beta lactam therapy was the
choice therapy, the allergy service was asked to comment on his
penicillin allergy. Penicillin desensitization was recommended
which was commenced without complication. Mr. [**Known lastname 11041**] was then
transitioned to nafcillin. Surveillance cultures remained
negative. It was recommended to continue nafcillin until
[**2161-10-28**]. Mr. [**Known lastname 11041**] continued to have periodic fever spikes in
the presence of a normal white cell count and normal healing
wounds. Pan-cultures continued to remain negative.

Cardiac:
The cardiac surgical service and cardiology service followed Mr.
[**Known lastname 11041**] closely. It was planned that his surgery may be
performed when surveillance blood cultures were negative. His
volume status and hemodynamics were optimized. A nicotine patch
was used to help with smoking cessation.

He was taken to the OR on [**9-18**], [**Month/Day (4) 1834**] tissue AVR (please see
operative note for details of surgical procedure). He was weaned
off pressors, continued on hemodialysis treatments, and was
extubated over the next 48 hours, and transfeerred to the
telemetry floor on POD # 2. He was followed closely by the ID
service.  OR cultures revealed MSSA, and penicilln was felt to
be the best treatment.  As the patient had an allergy to
penicillin, he was brought back to the ICU for desensitization
which he tolerated well.
On [**9-24**], he had an echocardiogram which revealed dehiscence of
his prosthetic aortic valve with abscess. On [**2161-9-29**], he was
taken to the OR for a re-do AVR/homograft.  Please see operative
report for details of procedure. On postoperative day one, he
self extubated himself without any complication. An ultrasound
of the upper extremities was obtained due to a question of clot
in the SVC in the OR.  This revealed bilateral subclavian vein
thrombus, and anticoagulation was initiated. His drains and
pacing wires were rmeoved per protocol. His volume overload was
removed by hemodialysis. Heparin was continued until his INR
became therapeutic on coumadin. On postoperative day three, he
was transferred back to the step down unit for further recovery.
The physical therapy service worked with him to help increase
his strength and mobility.

Mr. [**Known lastname 11041**] continued to make steady progress and was discharged
home on [**2161-10-7**]. He will resume his regular hemodialysis
schedule. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], his cardiologist,
the infectious disease service, his primary care physician and
the renal service as an outpatient.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2262**] was taken to the OR on [**4-30**] for exploratory
laparotomy, resection of gastrojejunostomy and Billroth II
anastomosis, with Roux-en-Y reconstruction, partial transverse
colectomy with primary anastomosis, feeding jejunostomy for
recurrent GIB and history of gastric CA. Postoperatively, the
patient was taken to the SICU for recovery. He was extubated and
did well over the course of POD 0. His hematocrits were stable
in the 26-27 range. His TF were started via the J tube. His NGT
was to suction. On POD 1, he remained hemodynamically stable and
tolerated his tube feeds however his hematocrits started to
slowly decrease. He was transferred to the floor on POD 2 and
given his persistent anemia with a hct of 21, he was transfused
two units of PRBC.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor his hematocrit remained
stable in the 30-32 range.  He began tube feeds via his J tube
and tolerated them well.  The speech and swallow service
evaluated him on multiple occasions but he had frank aspiration
on video swallow and therefore was given sips of nectar thick
liquids for comfort. He will need this followed up.

He required mineral oil via his J tube to start his bowel
function and it was effective.  As he is prone to constipation
his narcotic pain medication was stopped and he was given
scheduled Tylenol for pain. He will continue Senna and Colace as
well.

His Surgical wound was healing well and some of his staples were
removed prior to discharge.  The remaining staples will be
removed at his first post op appointment. He had an abdominal CT
on [**2201-5-6**] as he has had a right inguinal hernia nut had a bit
more pain on palpation.  The CT was done and confirmed that the
hernia sac was fat and fluid filled as opposed to bowel and his
pain gradually resolved.

The Physical Therapy service evaluated him and recommended a
stay in a short term rehab prior to returning home to increase
his mobility and endurance after this hospitalization.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2196-9-27**], he underwent deceased donor liver transplant.
Surgeon was Dr.[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Two 19-French [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains were
placed posterior to the liver and behind the portal structures.
Please refer to operative note for complete details. Aggressive
blood product resuscitation by anesthesiology staff as well as
administration of protamine was performed. Induction
immunosuppression was started intraop (solumedrol).

Postop, he was transferred to the SICU for management where he
received blood products to maintain hemodynamic stability per
protocol. LFTs initially increased as expected. Hepatic duplex
revealed inadequate flow demonstrated within the right posterior
portal vein which could have been technical in nature versus a
small amount of thrombus. Patency and appropriate direction of
flow within the hepatic arteries, hepatic veins, and the left
and main portal veins was seen. Splenomegaly was noted. A repeat
study on [**10-1**] revealed patency and appropriate direction of flow
within the hepatic and portal venous systems. High flow
velocities in the main portal vein, with aliasing in the
expected region of the anastomosis were noted. There was
notation of fatty infiltration of the liver. LFTs trended down
(ast 580, alt 530, alk phos 130, t.bili 6.6). JP outputs
remained high averaging 900-1100ml per day. LFTs started to
trend up on postop day 4 and 5. JP output appeared foamy.

On [**10-4**], an ERCP was performed noting common bile duct with mild

narrowing at the bile duct anastomosis, and minimal associated
proximal ductal
dilatation. There were no filling defects in the CBD or
intrahepatic ducts.
There was no evidence of bile leakage. A plastic biliary stent
was placed. Post procedure, amylase and lipase were wnl. JP
drain outputs continued to be high averaging as much as
2200ml/day. IV fluid replacements and albumin were administered
per output. The lateral JP was removed on [**10-5**]. The medial JP
continued to drain as much as 1800ml per day. IV lasix was given
for anasarca over several days. Teds stockings were applied with
improvement of edema. Weight decreased to 90.4 Kg on [**10-16**] from
117.4 on [**9-26**]. The medial JP was removed on [**9-14**]. The site
remained dry after suturing.

Of note, alk phos continued to rise to 518. Repeat ERCP was done
on [**10-13**]. There was no obstruction of the biliary stent. The
stent was exchanged. The alk phos continued to increase. On
[**10-14**], a liver biopsy was performed noting no rejection. Marked
bile ductular proliferation with associated neutrophilic
inflammation, focal ductal dilation, marked cholestasis, bile
plug formation and portal tract edema; Rare foci of mild portal
mononuclear inflammation with scattered eosinophils; no
endothelialitis or diagnostic involvement by acute cellular
rejection identified. No steatosis or viral inclusion was seen.
Rare peri-venular lipofuscin-laden macrophages, suggestive of
resolving reperfusion injury. After the ERCP, LFTS trended down
(ast 31, alt 33, alk phos 276, t.bili 1.6). The postop pyloric
feeding tube was replaced on [**10-6**] as this was removed during the
ERCP.

He experienced ATN likely from intraop hemodynamics. Creatine
was 1.0 on on [**9-27**]. This started to rise postop to as high as
5.2 on postop day 5. Very gradually, creatinine improved with.
Creatinine decreaed to 1.8 on [**10-13**], but started to trend up
again to 2.0 likely from Prograf as this trough was elevated.
Levels increased to 14.1 on [**10-16**]. Prograf dose was adjusted to
0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-16**] for 1mg [**Hospital1 **]. Immunusuppression consisted of
cellcept 1gram [**Hospital1 **] which was well tolerated. Solumedrol which
was tapered per transplant protocol to prednisone. Prograf was
started on postop day 1 and adjusted per trough levels.

Diet was slowly advanced, but poorly tolerated as the patient
had no appetite. A postpyloric feeding tube was placed and tube
feedings were started (novasource renal). Oral intake slowly
increased, but was insufficient to support caloric needs.

On [**10-10**] Dermatology biopsied his L thumb for a chronic
non-healing, bleeding punctate lesion (started in [**4-21**]). Biopsy
report noted many features suggestive of lichen simplex
chronicus/prurigo nodularis, and the mild atypia which is
present is favored to be reactive in this context. The central
ulceration could be secondary to excoriation; alternatively, it
may represent a channel for transepidermal elimination of a
foreign body or in the setting of a perforating disorder
(although the clinical history is not suggestive of the latter).
 An underlying pyogenic granuloma cannot be entirely excluded on
the basis of this sample; if clinical suspicion persists, deeper
sampling may be helpful for more definitive diagnostic
evaluation. The bleeding stopped and site remained clean and
dry.

PT worked with him extensively during this hospital course for
deconditioning. He did experience a fall onto right hip(slipped
while transferring to bed). He had pain with hip flexion and
pain on exam over greater trochanter. Xrays of the hip were
negative. He required contact guard and a rolling walker at time
of discharge, but was not ready for discharge to home. Rehab was
recommended and [**Hospital1 **] accepted him. He was transferred there
on [**10-17**].

output and immodium was initiated. The following day the
ileostomy output was acceptable, she was taught by the
wound/ostomy nursing team as well as the floor nursing team to
care for her ileostomy and how to monitor herself for signs and
symptoms of dehydration and how to measure and record her the
ileostomy output. Her prednisone taper was continued as an
outpatient.

Pain management: As the patient's bowel function returned she
was progressed from intravenous morphine and dilaudid PCA to
pain medications by mouth. The patients pain was adequately
controlled by the discharge pain regimen.

colitis. You have tolerated this procedure well, tolerated a
regular diet, your pain is well controlled with pain medications
by mouth and you are now ready to be disharged home. Please
monitor your bowel function closely. You have a new ileostomy
which puts you at risk for dehydration if you do not monitor the
output from your ostomy and do not repleate yourself with enough
fluid. It is important to monitor the output from the ostomy.
The goal for your ileostomy output is to  put out between
500cc-1200cc daily. The ileostomy output has been high prior to
your discharge, you have been started on immodium 2mg twice
daily, please take this and monitor your ostomy output. You will
also be taking metamucil wafers as ordered. As your stool
becomes thickened, you may titrate these medications. Please
call the office if you have any questions. Care for your ostomy

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 57 y/o Spanish speaking female with h/o HTN, DM2, CAD s/p
4VCABG, hyperlipidemia, and asthma who presented to the ED with
hypotension, now resolved, a brief episode of chest pain, ruled
out, and abdominal pain, likely Gas/GERD.
.
1. Hypotension: the patient had nausea and vomiting prior to
admission and was found to be hypotensive at her PCP's office.
She was actually given lasix initially and started on dopamine
gtt. It is unclear from the note if she got fluid. The
hypotension was probably due to dehydration from vomiting the
week prior to admission. Dopamine gtt was weaned off and the
patient had no further issues with hypotension. She was
discharged on lisinopril and atenolol. Lasix dose was decreased
to 20 mg QD and her KCl was d/c'd because we halved her lasix
and her K on discharge was 5.1.
.
2. Renal Failure: Patient came in with a creatinine of 1.6 and
her baseline is unknown. Could be chronic renal failure from DM
that is giving her chronic renal insufficiency and perhaps she
was also prerenal from the vomiting prior to admission.
Creatinine steadily improved and is now 1.3 on discharge.
 .
3. Anemia: Crit on admission was 25. Likely ACD from DM. s/p
transfusion of 2 units in the CCU. HCT improving. Crit now 31.8.

.
4. DM2:bedtime sugar was 152, fasting this am 73 and at noon
118. We continued actos and avandia as well as a RISS and
patient was advised to take her home doses of lantus and regular
insulin at home.
.
5. HTN: Blood pressure was stable after dopamine gtt was
titrated off in the CCU. No issues of hypertension or
hypotension. Discharged patient on atenolol and lisinopril.
.
6. CAD: Patient denies chest pain. Lipid profile showed LDL 84,
HDL 54. We continued ASA, atenolol, lisinopril. No acute issues.
.
7. Asthma: no wheezing, stable sats. We gave the patient
albuterol PRN.

Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year-old
female with a history of rectal cancer who was admitted to
[**Hospital1 69**] on [**2120-11-9**] for a low
anterior resection of her rectal cancer with ileostomy and
omental flap placement over the stump.  Her initially course
was complicated by necrosis of the omental pouch and a
prolonged postoperative ileus.  Multiple CT scans of her
abdomen revealed no evidence of obstruction and the ileus was
thought to be secondary to inflammation and irritation from
the necrotic omentum.  On [**12-18**], the patient was found to be
less responsive with increasing respiratory effort.  An
arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.22, CO2 100 and a PA2
of 84 on 3 liters of oxygen.  At this point the patient was
intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

From a respiratory standpoint, the patient was extubated on
the following day, but required reintubation after three days
secondary to increasing secretions and need for constant
pulmonary toilet.  The patient remained difficult to wean.
This was attributed to volume overload secondary to diastolic
dysfunction as well as a component of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  A sputum culture from [**12-18**] subsequently
grew MRSA and the patient was treated with a ten day course
of Vancomycin.  The patient was finally extubated on [**1-5**]
after extensive diuresis.  From a gastrointestinal standpoint
a CT of the abdomen on [**12-16**] revealed a communication between
Hartmann's pouch and the peritoneal cavity with an abdominal
fluid collection.  Per the Surgery Service the collection was
noted to be draining into the rectal stump and
they recommended no further surgical management.

From an infectious disease standpoint four out of four blood
culture bottles from [**12-5**] and [**12-6**] grew coag negative
staphylococcus, which has been treated with Vancomycin.
Surveillance cultures from [**12-28**] revealed no growth to date.
As mentioned previously, the patient had a sputum on [**12-18**],
which grew MRSA.  Blood cultures from [**12-18**] subsequently grew
[**Female First Name (un) **] [**Female First Name (un) 29361**], and the patient completed a fourteen day
course of Fluconazole on [**1-4**].  Lastly, sputum from [**1-4**]
grew Pseudomonas.  The Infectious Disease Service was
consulted and they believed the patient is colonized,
particularly since she currently has no evidence of
pneumonia.

From a cardiac standpoint there has been concern about volume
overload secondary to diastolic dysfunction.  The patient had
an echocardiogram on [**12-19**], which revealed a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 55% and unremarkable chamber sizes and
thicknesses.  There was also concern about coronary artery
disease.  The patient reportedly had a cardiac
catheterization at the outside hospital with a 30% left
anterior descending coronary artery and a 50% right coronary
artery.  She had several episodes of atypical chest pain
during her stay and was ruled out for myocardial infarction
multiple times.  During her MICU stay the patient had
frequent episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  She has
been treated with Amiodarone and Lopressor with good effects.

From a nutrition standpoint the patient was initially on
total parenteral nutrition, but this was discontinued after
the [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**] fungemia.  The patient has since been
on tube feeds via nasogastric tube and is at her goal.

From a psychiatric standpoint the patient has been profoundly
depressed and is being followed by the Psychiatry Service.
There was on episode of a self extubation attempt.  At this
point they do not feel that she is a suicide risk.  She has
been tried on Celexa and Ritalin without benefit.  She is
currently on Wellbutrin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Rectal carcinoma status post
radiation therapy and chemosensitization and low anterior
resection on [**2120-11-15**].  2.  Hypertension with a question
diastolic dysfunction.  3.  Coronary artery disease with a
30% left anterior descending coronary artery, 50% right
coronary artery.  4.  Status post cholecystectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, Erythromycin and intravenous contrast
(but she can tolerate the contrast).

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d.,
Wellbutrin 100 mg po t.i.d., Lasix 80 mg po b.i.d., Prevacid
30 mg po q.d., Amiodarone 400 mg po q.d., Atrovent, Colace
100 mg po b.i.d., Reglan 10 mg po q.i.d., heparin subQ,
Tylenol prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.  She has a
positive tobacco history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a temperature of 99.9.
Her blood pressure was 129/34.  Heart rate 78.  Respiratory
rate 30.  She was sating 100% of 4 liters of oxygen by nasal
cannula.  In general, the patient was a sad, but conversant
older female in no acute distress.  Neck examination she had
a jugulovenous pressure of approximately 8 cm of water.  Her
neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular
examination regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Respiratory examination, the patient had decreased
breath sounds bilaterally as well as soft bibasilar rales.
Abdomen examination the patient had positive bowel sounds.
Her abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.  Her colostomy
site was clean and intact.  Her extremities are warm without
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  She had 2+ dorsalis pedis
pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY:  The patient had a white blood cell count of
11.6, hematocrit 32.2, platelet count 376, sodium 137,
potassium 4.8, chloride 88, CO2 41, BUN 15, creatinine 0.4,
calcium 9.1, mag 1.8, phosphate 4.3.  Studies, the patient
had a chest x-ray on [**1-6**], which revealed interval
improvement in upper zone redistribution with a small left
pleural effusion and residual left lower lobe collapse with a
questionable consolidation in the retrocardiac region thought
to be secondary to atelectasis.  She had a CT of the abdomen
on [**12-25**], which revealed a collection of fluid and air within
the abdomen consistent with an abdominal abscess.  She had a
CT of the adomen on [**12-16**], which revealed a collection of
fluid and air within the abdomen with no identifiable
Hartmann's pouch.  She had a TTE on [**12-19**].  She was found to
have an ejection fraction of 60%.  Her left atrium was mildly
dilated.  Her left ventricular thickness and cavity size were
normal.  Her right ventricular thickness and size were
normal.  She was found to have a moderate mitral annular
calcification and 1+ mitral regurgitation.

Microbiologic data, sputum culture from [**1-4**] grew
Pseudomanas. On [**12-28**] MRSA, [**12-22**] MRSA and [**12-18**] MRSA.  Blood
cultures on [**12-28**] no growth times two sets.  [**12-18**] one out of
four [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**], [**12-6**] two out of two coag negative
staph.  [**12-5**] two out of two coag negative staph.  [**11-27**] no
growth times two.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the General
Medicine Service on [**1-6**] for further management.

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient had daily chest physical therapy
and an aggressive pulmonary toilet.  She was encouraged to
use her incentive spirometer.  We decided to treat the
patient with a course of Ciprofloxacin for the Pseudomonas in
her sputum.  We discussed her treatment with the infectious
disease fellow who did not think that she needed to be double
covered for the pan sensitive Pseudomonas in her sputum.  The
patient's respiratory status continued to improve on a daily
basis.  Her oxygen saturations improved dramatically to the
point that she required 3 to 4 liters by nasal cannula to
maintain appropriate oxygen saturation.

2.  Infectious disease:  As was mentioned previously we
treated the patient empirically for a Pseudomonas pneumonia
with Ciprofloxacin.  There was no clear evidence of
pneumonia, but given her history and tenuous status we opted
to treat her empirically with a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  From an
infectious disease standpoint the patient did very well.  She
did not have any overt signs of infection.  We followed her
blood cultures carefully and there was no additional growth
to date on her surveillance cultures.  Her white blood cell
count and fever curve remained within normal limits.

3.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient has been noted to have an
abdominal collection that is draining into the rectal stump.
She was followed by the Surgery Service during her stay and
they did not believe that she needed any further surgical
management.  Her abdominal examination remained benign.

4.  Cardiovascular:  From a cardiovascular standpoint we did
not have any evidence of acute ischemia, however, after her
stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient had
several episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  She was
continued on the Amiodarone and Lopressor.  Despite this she
did have several episodes during her stay on the general
medicine floor.  Each time she remained hemodynamically
stable with a ventricular response rate to the 150s.  She
responded quite well with low dose intravenous Lopressor
converting to sinus rhythm almost instantaneous.  We think
that the atrial fibrillation is secondary to all the
patient's general medical problems.  Toward the end of her
hospital stay the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm.
Despite this we opted to continue the Amiodarone and
Lopresor.  During her stay in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, the patient was felt to have a diastolic dysfunction,
but was noted to be very fluid sensitive and responsive to
Lasix.  By the time she arrived to the medical floor we felt
that she was euvolemic.

[**2142-12-23**] Liver US :
Gallstones, without gallbladder wall thickening or
pericholecystic fluid to suggest acute cholecystitis. No biliary
dilation.

[**2142-12-23**] CT Abd/pelvis :
1. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, no gallstones, the
gallbladder
is normal in appearance.

2. Slight mural hyperenhancement of the nondilated common
hepatic and common bile duct - can be seen with cholangitis.
2. Diverticula, no evidence of diverticulitis.

[**2142-12-23**] ERCP :
Esophageal web
Periampullary diverticulum
Successful biliary cannulation.
A single stricture that was 6 mm long was seen at the middle
third of the common bile duct.
There was an irregular appearance to the lining of bile duct,
likely secondary to cholangitis.
Sucessful sphincterotomy performed
Small 4mm stone was extracted.  Pus was seen exiting the bile
duct.
Successful plastic biliary stent placement
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
Possible Mirizzi's versus tumor as a cause of stricture.

[**2142-12-26**] CXR ;
1. New small-to-moderate right-sided pleural effusion with
parenchymal
opacity which could probably be explained by compressive
atelectasis, although pneumonia is an additional differential
consideration.
2. Similar left lower lung opacity which is a more chronic
finding.

[**2142-12-28**]:

INDICATION: CBD stricture of unclear etiology. Evaluate for
pancreatic mass.

COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen [**2142-12-23**] and ERCP [**12-23**], [**2142**].

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the abdomen was
performed prior
to and following the administration of 200 cc of IV Optiray
contrast.
Coronal, sagittal, volume-rendered and MIP reformats were
displayed.

CTA OF THE ABDOMEN: Left lower lobe bronchiectasis and small
bilateral
pleural effusions are unchanged from prior exam. There is
pneumobilia and a
common bile duct stent in place traversing the mid CBD stricture
seen on ERCP.
There is no soft tissue surrounding the CBD to definitively
suggest a biliary
malignancy. There is mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.
There is an
8-mm low-density lesion within segment V/VI of the liver
(3A:43), which is too
small to characterize but likely a cyst.

No intrahepatic lesions. The portal vein is patent. The hepatic
arterial
anatomy is conventional. The pancreas enhances homogeneously and
there is no
evidence of a pancreatic mass. The superior mesenteric artery
and vein are
patent and normal in caliber and course. There is a prominent 12
mm portal
hilar lymph node (3B:110), likely reactive. There is also a
13-mm precaval
node (3B:119).

The spleen, gallbladder, and adrenal glands are normal. The
kidneys enhance
and excrete contrast symmetrically with multiple subcentimeter
hypoattenuating
lesions which are too small to characterize but likely cysts. A
16-mm
exophytic fat-containing left renal lesion is consistent with an
angiomyolipoma (3A:66). There is a left extrarenal pelvis. No
ascites. No
mesenteric adenopathy. The small bowel loops are normal. There
are
moderately extensive colonic diverticula.

The bones are mildly osteopenic and there are degenerative
changes, however,
no concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION: Mild biliary dilation and stent within the CBD, with
no
pancreatic or biliary mass identified.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 72 year-old female with a who presented with acute
cholangits and was transfered for a ERCP and surgery evalaution.


# Acute Cholangitis: Pt has elevated LFTs and bili with RUQ pain
and fever of 102.9 at OSH. She was transfered for ERCP and
surgery eval. Pt had appearance of sepsis due to WBC from 9.4
with 56% bands at OSH to WBC of 31.3 and 30% bands in [**Hospital1 18**] ER
and fevers. ERCP showed stone obstruction with drainage of pus,
and stent was placed. Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] post procedure
and remained NPO. Her LFTs started to down trend post ERCP. 2
hours post ERCP she developed some hypotension with BP dropping
from mid 90s to 70s. She was mentating and making urine. She was
given IVF bolus with LR and her BP improved to 90-100. She was
given IVF as needed to maintain UO and SBP>90. She had no
further abd pain post procedre. She continued on tx with unasyn.
[**2142-12-23**] OSH blood cx are growing GNR 2/4 bottles as of [**2142-12-24**]
at 9AM. She was transferd to the SICU per request of the surgery
team.

# CBD Stricture: On ERCP pt was found to have a stricture of
unclear cause. She then had a pancreatic protocol CTA, which
showed Mild biliary dilation and stent within the CBD, with no
pancreatic or biliary mass identified.

# Cholelithiasis:  Following ERCP and sphincterotomy with stone
extraction, pt clincally stabilized and her LFTs gradually
returned to [**Location 213**].  At this point, she was taken to the
operating room for definitive management of her cholelithiasis.
Pt was found to have acute suppurative cholecystitis and
laproscopic cholecystectomy was performed.  She recovered
uneventfully from this procedure.

# Atrial fibrillation: She developed RAF to 150 on [**2142-12-25**] and
was given IV lopressor and subsequently Diltiazem with
conversion to NSR.  No further episodes.

# Possibe PNA: no clear resp sx or hypoxia. CT Abd showed some
lower lung fields with pulm bronchiectasis, which may expalin
the ER findings on her CXR. She has a 3 liter oxygen requirment
which is likely from IVF given in setting of sepsis.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she continued to make
good progress.  She remained free of any arrhythmias and was
gradually weaned off of oxygen with adequate saturations.  She
was up and ambulating independently and voiding without
difficulty.  Her diet was gradually advanced to regular and well
tolerated.

Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 65% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
LA/LAA or the
RA/RAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mechanical aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
leaflets move
normally.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.


PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.


PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic
signs of
tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient
was monitored
by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**] throughout the procedure. Local
anesthesia was
provided by benzocaine topical spray. The patient was sedated
for the TEE.

posterior pharynx was anesthetized with 2% viscous lidocaine. No
TEE related
complications. 0.2 mg of IV glycopyrrolate was given as an
antisialogogue
prior to TEE probe insertion.

Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the
aortic arch and simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. A mechanical
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic prosthesis
leaflets appear to
move normally. There is no paravalvular leak. The mitral valve
appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

AVR on [**2154-5-17**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Hospital1 827**].  [**Hospital 38**] rehab reported increased dyspnea,
tachypnea, diarrhea, and failure to thrive over the past 36-48
hours.

Upon admission she was seen in consultation by the renal
service.  She was dialyzed during her stay and her renal
function improved markedly.  It was determined that she likely
wound not need long term dialysis.  She was also seen in
consultation by the infectious disease service during her
admission and she was placed on Vancomycin per their
recommendations.  Once it was determined that she would not
require long term dialysis access, she was re-coumadinized for
her mechanical aortic valve.  By hospital day ###### she was
ready for discharge to a rehabiliation facility.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 89562**] is an 89 year-old right-handed woman with a history of
hypertension who was initially evaluated at BIDN following a
fall
and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] after she was found to have a
right thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.
.
The patient is high-functioning at baseline.  She lives
independently.  According to the patient's daughter, Ms. [**Known lastname 89562**]
was in her usual state of health until at least the day prior to
presentation.  This morning, there was no answer at the
patient's
door when the meal service came to deliver food.  Emergency
services were contact[**Name (NI) **].  The patient was reportedly found on
the
floor of a bathroom.  The patient's daughter shares that prior
to
transfer to the BIDN, the patient was ""groggy"" but could
identify
family members.  She was, however, disoriented (eg she thought
she was in the living room when she was actually in the
bathroom)
and was speaking ""rag-time.""
.
She was transferred to the BIDN for evaluation.  There she was
given morphine for head, left shoulder, and left hip pain from
the fall.  Imaging of the left hip, shoulder, c-spine, facial
bones and head was performed.  She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
when the non-contrast CT of the head was discovered to show
right
thalamic hemorrhage.

transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU was done. Here she was reevaluated
clnically and with CT scan of the head and neck. The bleed was
stable and her examination was stable so she was transferred to
the floor for further care. On the wards she was stable with
occasional events of A-fib with RVR to the 140's responsive to
IV Beta Blocker. There were no complications and she was started
on heparin SC. Her inital event was thought to be secondary to
hypertension. Her blood pressure was within goal but needed some

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2866**] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with a history of Parkinson's
disease, dementia, hypertension, and recent aspiration pneumonia
who presents with altered mental status and is admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hypoxic respiratory failure.

She was recently admitted in [**2132-6-26**] for delirium and
gradually worsening mental status and was found to have
aspiration PNA and treated with antibiotics.  This admission was
notable for a speech and swallow evaluation concluding in the
recommendation for aspiration precautions, and a discussion
about goals of care with his daughter and subsequent change in
his code status to DNI/DNR.

He was discharged to rehab and then transferred to [**Hospital1 **] nursing
home for long term care.  He was doing well until the day prior
to admission when his daughter noted that he was less oriented
than usual (he is A/0 to person and sometimes place or time at
baseline) and having a productive cough with difficulty managing
his oral secreations. He was transferred to the ED for further
evaluation.  ROS is notably negative for fevers, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, and rash.  EMS reports he was
92%ra.

In the ED, initial VS: 99.2 74 126/107 24 98%NRB. He was
tachypneic to the 40s with copious oral secretions.  O2 sats
fell to the high 80s and he was put on a NRB with improvement in
his hypoxia.  He was given 500cc NS initially because it was
felt she was dry, and then lasix 10iv x 1 because of concern for
volume overload.  She also received morphine for dyspnea.  CXR
showed mew LLL infiltrate and resolution of prior RLL pneumonia
and she was treated with vanc/levoflox.  He also had a negative
head CT.  He was initially admitted to the ICU for
stabilization.

IMAGING:
[**9-6**] CXR: Left basilar opacity concerning for infection with
small left
pleural effusion. Prominent hila bilaterally.

[**9-6**] CXR: There has been little change compared to the prior
study. Again noted is a left basilar airspace opacity concerning
for infection. Small left pleural effusion persists. There is a
patchy opacity as well on the right lung base which could
represent an atelectasis. Both hila remain prominent, and
underlying lymphadenopathy may be present. The cardiac and
mediastinal contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vascularity is not
engorged. Hemithorax. Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker leads
terminating in right atrium and right ventricle are again noted.


[**9-7**] CT Head w/o Contrast:
Essentially unchanged study from [**2132-7-6**]. No acute
intracranial process. Similar global atrophy, particularly
bifrontal, and unchanged cystic encephalomalacia in the left
cerebellar hemisphere.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2866**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo male w a history of Parkinson's disease,
dementia, hypertension, and recent aspiration pneumonia who
presents with altered mental status and is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
with hypoxia and tachypnea.

# Pulmonary Process:  Patient with recent admission for PNA in
[**Month (only) 205**], admitted with elevated WCC, AMS, CXR with new L basilar
opacity concerning for infection with small left pleural
effusion.  At this time it was believed this was secondary to a
recurrent aspiration pneumonia, however heart failure, PE and
atelectasis were also considered within the differential.  A
urine legionella antigen was negative.  He was started on
vancomycin, levofloxacin and cefepime to cover for hospital and
community acquired PNA, but then switched to vancomycin, cipro
and cefepime for better pseudomonal coverage.  Given the concern
for aspiration, he was ordered for a speech and swallow
evaluation, who has evaluated him previously for a similar
condition.  Once he was stabilized, he was transitioned to the
medicine HMED service, and he was gradually transitioned to PO
antibiotics with cipro and flagyl to avoid the need for a PICC
line.

# Dysphagia: Attributed to his underlying parkinson's and
dementia. Appears stable, per speech and swallow evaluation. A
ground diet with thin liquids was recommended., with aspiration
precautions, with special consideration made for the days that
his mental status is poor, to consider reassessing before
offering him food. Per discussions with his daughter/HCP [**Name (NI) **],
the decision was made for him to eat for comfort and not pursue
invasive measures related to the dysphagia.

# Acute kidney injury: On admission the patient's creatinine was
elevated to 1.6 from a baseline of 0.9.  This was believed to be
secondary to hypovolemic hypoperfusion.  In the ED, the patient
had received both a fluid bolus and a one-time dose of IV lasix
10mg.  On arrival in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient received an
additional fluid bolus.  His serum Cr stabilized at 1.5 and this
may be a new baseline.  He did not appear intravascularly
contracted or overloaded at the time of discharge.

# Goals of care: Extensive discussion with his HCP/daughter,
including a geriatrics inpatient consult, was helpful in
clarifying the patient's goals of care. The daughter expressed
interest in discussing goals of care and potential transition to
inpatient hospice in the near future. We discussed avoiding IV
antibiotics, as they would require a PICC line that he might
find uncomfortable, but did choose to have him remain on PO
antibiotics at this time. His prognosis due to the recurrent
aspirations is poor, and his daughter understands that the point
may arise when she no longer wishes for him to be readmitted to
the hospital. She will discuss the goals of care further with Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **], at [**Hospital1 **]. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] was updated by the writer on the
day prior to discharge.

of 5.5, with 11% bands, a hematocrit of 42.8, and a platelet
count of 239.  Chem-7 was significant for a sodium of 140,
potassium 3.8, chloride 93, bicarbonate 11, BUN 24,
creatinine 1.2, glucose 186.  Anion gap was 36.  ETOH level
was 370.  Acetone level was positive.  ABG on room air was pH
7.40, PCO2 26, PO2 85.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 65-year-old woman, with a history of
alcohol abuse, who presents with hypophosphatemia and
alcoholic ketoacidosis.  In the ED, she also had coffee
ground emesis, although her hematocrit remained stable.

HOSPITAL COURSE - The following is a summary of the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course by systems:

1) HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA:  The patient received ample phosphate
repletion while she was in-house, and on her day of discharge
was no longer hypophosphatemic.

2) ALCOHOLIC KETOACIDOSIS:  The patient was aggressively
treated with Insulin and glucose, fluids, and electrolyte
repletion in the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the extent
that her anion gap and acidosis resolved.

3) COFFEE GROUND EMESIS:  The patient was seen by the
gastrointestinal team while she was in-house.  Her hematocrit
was followed in the hospital and did not drop significantly.
She was started on PPI.  She was made NPO at first, but then
slowly advanced in her diet.  She underwent an EGD prior to
discharge which revealed no [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, erythema, and
erosion in the antrum compatible with gastritis, no
esophageal varices, and an otherwise normal EGD.  She was
continued on her PPI and will be continued for 4 weeks.
Biopsy results at the time of this dictation were pending.
The gastrointestinal team recommended follow-up appointment
as an outpatient, as well as a screening colonoscopy.

4) ALCOHOL INTOXICATION:  The patient was maintained on a
CIWA scale to monitor her for withdrawal.  She received
valium accordingly.  The patient was visited by the substance
abuse team, and the patient requested transfer to an
inpatient psych facility for treatment of her alcohol
dependence.

5) ESSENTIAL TREMOR:  The patient was treated with nadolol
with subsequent improvement of her essential tremor.  She
continued to have one, however, at baseline.

6) DEPRESSION:  The patient was continued on her Zoloft.

7) FEN:  The patient underwent aggressive electrolyte
repletion, as mentioned above.  She was made NPO at first,
but as her hematocrit remained stable and she had no
abdominal complaints, she was advanced as tolerated to a full
diet.

8) PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was treated with Protonix, as
mentioned above, as well as Pneumoboots and a bowel regimen.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital1 **] for inpatient substance abuse
treatment.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Alcoholic ketoacidosis with hypophosphatemia.
2. Essential tremor.
3. Depression.
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5. Gastritis.
6. Alcohol abuse.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient will follow-up with GI for a
colonoscopy, as well as follow-up of her coffee ground
emesis.  The patient will follow-up with her primary care
physician as needed.  The patient will receive inpatient
psych care at [**Hospital1 **].

Brief Hospital Course:
This 79 year old male presented to the emergency room with a
complaint of chest pain. His EKG showed no acute changes but his
cardiac bio markers were elevated.  He was admitted and
diagnostic cardiac catheterization showed severe coronary artery
disease.  Cardiac surgery was consulted for evaluation for
revascularization.

He was brought to the operating room on [**2174-12-21**] and underwent
4-vessel CABG.  Please see operative note for full details.  The
surgery was uncomplicated and he weaned from bypass on
neosynephrine. He was transferred to the cardiac surgical ICU
post-operatively for invasive hemodynamic monitoring.  He was
extubated on POD 1.  He required intravenous nitroglycerine for
several days to control his blood pressure.

He was gently diuresed towards his pre-operative weight and was
transferred to the step-down floor on POD 5. He failed speech
and swallow on POD 5 and had a video-swallow study on POD 6 he
was able to take a ground solids/thin liquids diet. This was
tolerated and advanced to soft on [**12-28**].
He remained stable and was ready for transfer to rehabilitation
for further recovery prior to return home. Discharge
instructions, medications and follow up instructions were
outlined with the transfer information.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 22yoM with a history of hepatitis C and polysubstance
abuse, who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further
management of a  NSTEMI thought to be secondary to aortic valve
vegetation embolism. He first presented on [**2148-10-26**] with fevers
and lightheadedness. He was found to have strep viridans
endocartiditis with large vegetation on his noncoronary cusp, as
well as posterior root seen on TEE. He was treated with
penicillin and Gentamicin and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] State on
[**11-14**], at which point he was transitioned to high dose
ceftriaxone.

He completed four weeks of antibiotics on [**2148-11-23**], and has been
without fevers, chills, malaise, weakness, sensory deficits,
vision abnormalities since that time.

He presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] 3 days ago with
anterior chest pain radiating to the left side, which started on
[**11-30**]. Troponin was found to be elevated at 2.09, and though
there were no acute EKG changes per report, he was treated for
NSTEMI with Lovenox and Plavix (ASA allergy). A TTE demonstrated
persistentce of a large aortic valve vegetation, along with
moderate-severe aortic regurgitation. An embolic vegetation is
suspected as the source of the NSTEMI. .

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2148-12-9**] 7:19
AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 22 year old man with s/p avr
Final Report: The patient is status post median sternotomy and
aortic valvular surgery, with stable post-operative appearance
of the cardiomediastinal contours. Minimal area of atelectasis
is again demonstrated in the right lower lobe, with otherwise
clear lungs. Extreme left lung base has been excluded from the
radiograph, precluding assessment for small left effusion or
peripheral basilar left lung abnormality.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after ruling in for NSTEMI at
[**Hospital6 3105**], has had been treated prior to that
admission for aortic valve endocarditis. An echo prior to
transferred revealed severe aortic regurgitation. Following
admission he remained stable.  Cardiac catheterization was not
performed due to risk of embolization of the vegetation.
Cardiac surgical consultation was requested.  On [**12-5**] he went
to the Operating Room after the usual preoperative workup,
please see operative report for details. In summary he had:
Aortic valve replacement with a 23-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve,
reference number [**Serial Number 88070**].
His bypass time was 101 minutes, with a crossclamp time of 84
minutes. He tolerated the operation well and post-operatively
was transferred to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition.
He remained hemodynamically stable, awoke intact was weaned from
the ventilator and extubated.  All tubes lines and drains were
removed per cardiac surgery protocols. He was started on
Bblockers, diuretics and anticoagulation the day following
surgery.
He transferred to the stepdown floor on POD 1. Physical Therapy
saw him for strength and mobility.  His Methadone was resumed,
he received opiates and Toradol for surgical pain.  The
remainder of his hospital course was uneventful, he continued to
make good progress and was cleared for discharge to home on POD
eight.  His INR is to be followed by [**Company 191**] coumadin clinic
starting on [**2147-12-17**]. His first INR check is the day after
discharge with results to cardiac surgery oncall staff at [**Hospital1 18**]
before [**12-17**] or [**Company 191**] coumadin clinic if after [**12-17**].  All follow-up
appointments were advised.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2200-11-16**] after being found unconscious
in his home for an unknown duration of time (likely >12hrs). The
patient was brought to an OSH and found to have a potassium of
6.9, creatinine 3.8, CK >20,000. The orthopedic service  was
consulted at OSH and compartment pressures were measured and
found to be elevated. Pt received Kayexalate 90mg and 3 doses of
10mg insulin w/ amps of D50 for hyperkalemia and was reportedly
given 8L crystalloid (NS). He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further workup and management.

ICU course:

On admission to the trauma ICU, a left sided IJ dialysis
catheter was placed for temporary dialysis access. He was taken
to the operating room by orthopedics for bilateral decompressive
fasciotomies of b/l gluteal and thigh compartments. VAC
dressings were placed. Postoperatively he received 4 U of PRBC
for dropping HCT in setting of copious VAC output, hypotension,
tachycardia with good results. He was dialyzed on HD1.
On HD2 he was taken back to OR for washout, debridement and VAC
change. He was successfully extubated later that day. Per
nephrology recommendations the patient did not undergo
hemodialysis on HD2. He remained oliguric. The patient was
transfused and additional unit of PRBC for falling HCT during
the day (22 from 28 preop). He was started on a Dilaudid PCA for
pain control. He received 2 U of PRBC overnight since the
response to the first unit had not been adequate. His HCT was
again 22.4 and 2 additional U of PRBC were given on HD3.
On HD4 he was taken back to the operating room by Ortho for
washout and closure of the RLE wound and VAC re-placement in the
[**Hospital1 **]. Postoperatively he remained intubated for acute
desaturation and was hypoxemia. A CXR showed bilateral pleural
effusions, greater on the right. A bronchoscopy was also
performed.
On HD5 the patient was able to be extubated and CXR showed
slight improvement in b/l pleural effusions. The patient
received HD. His HCT remained stable at 23.2. The patient was
deemed ready for transfer to the regular surgical floor.

Floor course:

Upon transfer out of the ICU he continued to progress slowly.
His acute kidney injury continued to warrant close monitoring
and hemodialysis treatments 3-4x/week. His BUN/Cr were followed
closely remaining quite elevated until [**12-4**] when it was down to
5.6 after peaking at 10.3 on [**11-24**]. His temporary dialysis line
was removed due to fever and elevated white blood. Once his
fevers defervesced a right tunneled catheter for dialysis was
placed without any complications. He has received several
treatments since that time with most recent on [**2200-12-3**] where his
pre-dialysis creatinine was 8.8 and as noted previously on [**12-4**]
was 5.6 and he is making urine (total of 300 cc's for 24 hours
on [**12-3**]). His electrolytes in general were abnormal due to his
[**Last Name (un) **] and have begun to show signs of return to normal. It is
expected that he will only require hemodialysis for another 1
possibly 2 weeks if he continues to show signs of improving
kidney function.

It should also be noted that he has received several rounds of
blood transfusions for falling HCT with lowest value of 17.9 on
[**2200-11-25**]. His HCT's since that time have ranged between 23-24.
For a very short period he was given weekly Epogen but this was
stopped per recommendations of Renal on [**2200-12-3**].

On [**2200-11-27**] he was taken back to the operating room by
orthoepdics for irrigation and debridement down to and inclusive
of muscle of 40 x 10 cm wound for a total of 400 sq cm, and
staged primary closure. There were no complications.

His staples were removed by Orthopedics on [**12-3**] and he will
follow up in [**2-27**] weeks in their outpatient clinic. In the
meantime he is receiving DVT prophylaxis with Heparin SQ,
orthopedics is asking that once he is discharged from rehab that
he be started on Aspirin 325 mg daily for a total 2 weeks.

He is also being treated for a wound cellulitis per
recomendations by ortho - total 7 day course. It is important
that on his HD days that he receives this medication after
dialysis treatment.

He was followed by Physical and Occupational therapy and has
been recommended for acute rhab after his hospital stay.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66 year old female
admitted on [**2127-7-11**], mid afternoon, four days after
discharge from the Thrombus Service where she had had a right
pneumothorax and right-sided rib fractures due to a motor
vehicle accident.  At that time she had been discharged to a
rehabilitation facility, primarily due to her social
situation where she was considered to a fall risk and she
lives at home alone without any social support.  One day
prior to admission, staff at the skilled nursing facility
noticed increased drainage from the chest tube wound sight
and today the patient was noted to have a temperature of
101.6.  The patient has also noticed worsening shortness of
breath.  She was transported back to [**Hospital6 649**] and admitted back to the Trauma Service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post motor vehicle crash ten
days prior with multiple right rib fractures, status post
right-sided chest tube, glaucoma, chronic neuritic pain,
depression and otherwise nonspecified psychiatric history,
most likely a paranoid personality disorder.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post left open reduction and
internal fixation of the tibial plateau and status post
bilateral hip replacement.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Timolol, eye drops for glaucoma,
Nortriptyline 75 mg q.d., Neurontin 600 mg t.i.d., Colace,
Celexa 10 mg q.d., Percocet prn and Ibuprofen.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has stated allergies to Effexor,
Penicillin and Topamax, none of which were related to rash or
shortness of breath by her history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on arrival showed
temperature 97.6, heartrate 98, blood pressure 145/37 and
respiratory rate 18.  Oxygen saturations were 82% on room air
and 99% on nonrebreather.  The patient was awake and alert in
no acute distress, not tachypneic.  There was a right-sided
chest crepitus palpated and auscultated.  Left side of the
lung, decreased breathsounds as well at the base.  There was
no jugulovenous distension.  Heart had a regular rate.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and had good bowel sounds.  The
left knee had an area of ecchymosis but was not tender to
palpation nor warm to the touch.  Left eye also had some
ecchymosis from a prior hematoma on the left anterior portion
of her scalp.

LABORATORY DATA:  Initial laboratory data were significant
for a white count of 19.8, hematocrit 28, the patient having
a baseline hematocrit at discharge between 28 and 30.
Urinalysis with numerous white blood cells.  Initial
radiology, chest x-ray was obtained showing left lower lobe
and right lower lobe consolidation, as well as a right lower
lobe effusion.  Electrocardiogram was performed which showed
no acute change from her prior electrocardiogram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the floor for
possible empyema versus pneumonia versus urinary tract
infection and started on Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone.  It was
difficult to maintain the patient's oxygenation due to her
pain.  A chest tube was attempted to be placed but was placed
in the chest wall and not in the intrapleural space.  Said
chest tube was discontinued and upon thoracic surgery
consultation was not felt to be needed.  The chest
computerized tomographic angiography was required to rule out
pulmonary embolism which showed the patient to be without
emboli.  Chest computerized tomography scan did reveal a
small right apical pneumothorax as well as a small right
hydropneumothorax near the pulmonary artery and atelectasis
versus pneumonia at the right middle lobe.  Aggressive chest
physical therapy and antibiotics gradually improved the
patient's oxygenation until she was sating well on simple
nasal cannula.  Antibiotics were switched over to Levaquin
and as her condition has improved, she is stable for transfer
back to the rehabilitation facility where it is crucial that
she use incentive spirometry, has gotten out of bed as often
as possible and that her pain is managed well to prevent
relapse of possible pneumonia.  She should follow up at the
Trauma Clinic in one to two weeks and should have an
outpatient colonoscopy scheduled as she has a persistent
anemia with heme positive stools.  After she is done
completing her course of Fluoroquinolones it is recommended
that she be started on iron therapy but not prior to
finishing her Levaquin as Fluoroquinolone levels are reduced
in the face of concurrent iron therapy.  At this time the
patient is discharged with the following diagnoses.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Right rib fractures from prior motor vehicle accident
status post second chest tube insertion
2.  Urinary tract infection
3.  Pneumonia
4.  Loculated hydropneumothoraces on the right times two
5.  Anemia

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Nortriptyline 75 mg h.s.
2.  Neurontin 600 mg t.i.d.
3.  Docusate 100 mg b.i.d.
4.  Celexa 10 mg q.d.
5.  Dilaudid 2 to 4 mg p.o. q. 6 hours prn for ten days
6.  Levaquin 500 mg q.d. for nine days

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Chest physiotherapy one to two times
per day as well as physical therapy for general strengthening
and gait safety.  It is expected that as her condition
improves she will be safe to be discharged back home.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 year old female with a history of of hepatitis C and
alcoholic cirrhosis and known Grade I varices who presented with
UGIB secondary to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear.

#UGIB- The patient has a history of esophageal varices and is
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for her cirrhosis. She is on nadalal as
one of her home medications. She developed hematemesis in the
ED, where she received 3L crystalloid and 2 units of PRBC. She
was trasnferred to the MICU, and she had an EGD  performed by GI
which revealed [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tears of the esophagus. She was
monitored in the MICU and her HCT remained stable throughout her
MICU stay. She was started on sucralfate and received 48 hours
of a protonix drip. After transfer to the floor, she continued
to remain hemodynamically stable, although did continue to have
melanic stools. Her HCT continued to remain stable at discharge.
She was sent home with sucralfate and pantoprazole daily, along
with iron supplementation in the setting of acute blood loss.

#Hypovolemic shock- Patient presented with hypotension and
elevated lactate which resolved with fluid resusciation and
blood products.  Since her EGD, she remained hemodynamically
stable, her lactate trended down, and she required no additional
blood products.

#Altered mental status- Patient was found altered at home while
intoxicated. She had a positive flapping tremor and was started
on lactulose at time of transfer from MICU. The patient was
continued on a CIWA scale on the floor, and required minimal
diazepam for symptoms.

#Cirrhosis- Patient has alcoholic/HepC cirrhosis. SHe is
followed in the liver clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She is still actively
drinking per her postiive blood alcohol today in the ED.  Her
MELD score is 15. She has thormbocytopenia and known esophageal
varices. She has no history of ascites or hepatic
encephalopathy, however had a flapping tremor and was somnolent
at time of d/c from MICU, which was persistent on the floor. She
was treated with a 4d course of ceftriaxone in the setting of GI
Bleed.

#Alcohol abuse- Patient came to MICU intoxicated to >200 BAL.
Social work was consulted. The patient demonstrated interest in
attending AA after discharge.

#Hypertension- Patient was normotensive during MICU admission,
nadolol was restarted on transfer from MICU and continued on the
floor. Her home lasix and lisinopril were held in the setting of
GI bleeding, and she had no signs of fluid overload on the day
of discharge so these were not restarted.

#hypokalemia - K around 3.3-3.5. Unknown etiology. Was repleted
with PO K.

#Depression- Patient was restarted on citalopram once she was
able to tolerate PO

#Migraines- Fiorecet was held while in the hospital.

The patient was full code throughout admission.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Pt will need weekly labs to follow hypokalemia and hematocrit
for several weeks, has f/u appt with primary care [**10-14**]. Has

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],

You were recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after you were found to have
altered mental status. While you were here, you had an EGD after
some vomitting of blood which showed no change in your varices,
but there was evidence of tearing which most likely caused the
bleeding. There have been no changes to your home medications.
It is imperitive that you discontinue drinking, as this was the
most likely cause of your hospital admission. It was our
pleasure to take care of you while you were a patient here.
Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions,
comments or concerns.

With Warm Regards,

Your Inpatient Medicine Team

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the trauma ICU.

[**8-29**] - Patient was admittd to the ICU. He was taken to the
operation room with ortho for ORIF of his right femur (see
operative report for full details).  Neurosurgery was consulted
and an ICP was placed.  He was started on dilantin and q1 hour
neurochecks.

[**Date range (1) 58392**] - The patient was transfused 4u PRBC for a decreasing
Hct.  He had a right femur hematoma which was expanding but his
limb was soft and there was no fear of compartment symdrome.
His Hct stabilized. Head CT was stable.

[**9-1**] - His ICP was discontinued and neurosurgery signed off.
Head CT was stable.

[**9-2**] - MR of head and c-spine were performed.

[**9-3**] - Bilateral LE and LUE LENIs were performed which
demonstrated no DVT.

[**9-4**] - The patient went the OR with the acute care service for
tracheostomy and IVC filter placement.

[**9-6**] - Patient dc'ed his dophoff tube twice.

[**9-7**] - A CT A/P was done because of persistent fevers and rising
white count.  No source for his fevers was identified.  Patient
was put to trach collar.

[**9-8**]: Awake, off-versed, following commands. Passed S&S for
regular diet and Passy [**Last Name (un) 87596**] Valve. BAL cultures grew MRSA, kept
only on Vanc now. Patient ready to be transferred to floor,
waiting for a bed. `

Following transfer to the Surgical floor he continued to make
slow progress.  His trach tube was plugged with a PMV and he
tolerated it well.  After confirming no aspiration by video
swallow he was tolerating a regular diet with thin liquids.

The Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy services followed
him on a daily basis to increase his mobility and increase
cognitive abilities.  His memory is decreased and he
occasionally has some confusion but is improving each day.

He has a PICC line placed on [**2177-9-12**] for IV antibiotics and will
require Vancomycin thru [**2177-9-16**] for MRSA pneumonia.  He has
minimal secretions but is undergoing nebulizer treatments.

Potentially his IVC filter can be removed but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will re
evaluate in a few weeks therefore he will need to return to the
[**Hospital 2536**] Clinic. He will also follow up in the Neuro cognitive clinic
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] following his discharge from rehab.

After a lonfg hospitalization he was transferred to rehab on
[**2177-9-12**] for further therapy with the goal to return home soon.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted post-operatively to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU under
Dr.[**Name (NI) 24219**] Urology service.  He remained intubated overnight
due to the length of the case, but did well overnight, weaning
on vent settings appropriately and he was extubated without
difficulty on POD 1.  His heparin anticoagulation was restarted
approximately 8 hours after surgery at 1 am on [**2166-2-28**].  On POD
1, his PTT ranged from 65.7-94.3.  In late POD 1, early POD 2,
he was noted to have a decreasing hct, for which he received a
transfusion of 2u pRBCs.  However, after transfusion, his hct
did not change.  His UOP decreased and his creatinine increased
from 1.8 immediately postoperatively to 4.1 on early POD 2.  Of
note, he was given two doses of lasix 40 mg IV on POD 1.  A CT
scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast was performed, which
demonstrated a large R retroperitoneal hematoma.  Heparin gtt
was stopped and the patient was transfused as necessary to keep
his hct > 25.  He received a total of 7u of pRBCs, after which
his hct stabilized off anticoagulation.

Cardiology was consulted regarding the safety of stopping
anticoagulation with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mechanical valve present.
They concluded that the risk of restarting anticoagulation would
clearly have to be weighed against the risk of bleeding, but
that 3-4 days off anticoagulation would not lead to excessive
risk.  The patient's heparin was restarted in the evening of his
third day off anticoagulation, and the pt had no evidence of
bleeding for the rest of his hospital stay.

Renal was consulted regarding the patient's acute renal failure,
which was thought to be secondary to acute tubular necrosis as a
consequence of transient hypoperfusion of the remaining kidney
either intraoperatively or postoperatively during his bleeding
episode.  The patient's creatinine peaked at 5.3 on [**2166-3-2**],
after which his urine output improved significantly and his
renal function began to improve, settling out at 1.8 on
[**Date Range **].  He did not require dialysis during this
hospitalization.

After heparin was restarted and the patient's hct was noted to
be stable with a therapeutic PTT, the pt was transferred from
the ICU to the floor.  The remainder of his hospital course was
uncomplicated, and involved restarting coumadin to reach a
therapeutic INR of 2.5-3.5.  This required coumadin doses of 7.5
mg PO qhs to eventually reach an INR of 2.5 upon [**Date Range **].  The
patient's primary care physician was [**Name (NI) 653**], who recommended
discharging the patient on his home coumadin dose (3.0) with a
plan to follow-up with the pt's PCP three days later for an INR
check and coumadin dose adjustment.

Of note, one day before [**Name (NI) **], the pt was noted to have
small openings in his R flank wound in its medialmost- and
lateralmost edges.  This breakdown was probed, and was noted to
be purely superficial, < 1 cm in depth and approximately 1-2 cm
in width.  Steri strips with benzoin were applied and dry gauze
was applied.  The patient was asked to call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] if his
wound drainage worsened or if the wound opened up further.
Before he was [**First Name (STitle) **], new steri strips were applied to the
extent of his wound.  He was discharged in stable condition,
voiding without difficulty, ambulating without difficulty, and
tolerating a regular diet.  He will call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for a
follow-up appointment.

bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated previously, the patient was a
direct admission to the operating room on [**2140-11-11**], at which
time she underwent a supracoronary ascending aortic graft
with a resuspension of the aortic valve.  Please see the
operative report for full details.   The patient tolerated
the operation well and was transferred from the operating
room to Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  Circ arrest time
was eleven minutes.  At the time of transfer, the patient had
Milrinone at 0.4 mcg/kg/minute, Amiodarone at 1 mg per
minute, Neo-Synephrine no dose indicated and Propofol, also
no dose indicated.  The patient did well in the immediate
postoperative period.  Her anesthesia was reversed.  She was
weaned from the ventilator.  In the morning of postoperative
day one, she was successfully extubated.  On postoperative
day number one, her cardioactive medications were begun to be
weaning beginning with Amiodarone and Milrinone.  By
postoperative day two, the patient was maintained with
minimal amounts of Amiodarone, Milrinone and Nipride.  On
postoperative day two, the patient's Milrinone was
discontinued.  Her Amiodarone was changed to p.o.  Her
Nipride was discontinued with initiation of beta blockade.
Her chest tubes were removed.  She was maintained in the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit for monitoring of her
hemodynamic and pulmonary status.  On postoperative day
three, the patient continued to do well.  She remained
hemodynamically stable.  She was transferred from the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Two for continuing
postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.  Once on the
floor, it was noted that the patient had gone into sustained
atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 100 to 110,
hemodynamically tolerated well.  She was seen by the
electrophysiology service and was maintained on her p.o.
Lopressor as well as her p.o. Amiodarone and continued to be
monitored on the floor.  Over the next two days, the patient
was in and out of atrial fibrillation.  She remained
hemodynamically stable throughout these periods.  On
postoperative day five, it was noted that the patient had a
drop in her hematocrit with guaiac positive stools.  She was
seen by the gastroenterology service.  At that time, she was
also transferred back to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit for close monitoring.  The patient underwent a KUB which
was read as normal.  She also had stools sent for Clostridium
difficile which were negative.  She was empirically started
on Flagyl at that time.  The patient remained in the
Intensive Care Unit for the next several days to monitor her
gastrointestinal status to make sure that she had no further
guaiac positive stools.  On postoperative day seven, she was
again transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative
care.  Prior to transfer from the Intensive Care Unit, it was
noted that the patient had some left upper extremity
swelling.  She underwent ultrasonography of her upper
extremities at that time to rule out a thrombosis.
Ultrasound showed a right internal jugular and cephalic
thrombus.  Following transfer, the vascular service was
consulted and they recommended oral anticoagulation with
Coumadin, which was begun at that time.  Over the next
several days, with the exception of intermittent atrial
fibrillation, the patient had an uneventful hospital course.
She was again seen by the electrophysiology service given her
episodes of atrial fibrillation, the last episode lasting
greater than 24 hours.  The patient was additionally begun on
Heparin given the duration of this episode of atrial
fibrillation.  The patient was scheduled for a direct current
cardioversion, however, prior to cardioversion, the patient
spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm.   On
postoperative day twelve, it was decided that if the patient
remained in a rate controlled rhythm for the next 24 hours,
she would be stable and ready to be transferred to
rehabilitation.

At the time of this dictation, the patient's physical
examination is as follows;  vital signs revealed temperature
98.2, heart rate 71, sinus rhythm, blood pressure 147/68,
respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 98% in room air.
Weight preoperatively was 50 kilograms and at transfer to
rehabilitation is 53 kilograms.  Laboratory data on [**2140-11-23**],
white blood cell count 11.7, hematocrit 34.5, platelet count
219,000.  Prothrombin time 15.0, partial thromboplastin time
25.0 with Heparin off.  INR is 1.5.  Sodium is 129, potassium
4.8, chloride 95, CO2 29, blood urea nitrogen 16, creatinine
0.8, glucose 183.  The patient is alert and oriented times
three, moves all extremities, follows commands.  Respiratory
revealed scattered rhonchi.  Cardiac is regular rate and
rhythm with no murmur.  The sternum is stable and incision
with Steri-strips open to air, clean and dry.  The abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well perfused with no edema.  Right
upper arm with minimal edema which has been resolving over
the last several days.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. three times a day times one week
and then 200 mg p.o. once daily times one month.
3.  Metoprolol 100 mg twice a day.

7.  Heparin 600 units per hour to keep partial thromboplastin
time 40 to 60 until INR is therapeutic.
8.  Warfarin to maintain an INR between 2.0 and 2.5.   The
patient received 2 mg of Coumadin two days prior to discharge
and no Coumadin on one day prior to discharge and 2 mg of
Coumadin on the night before discharge.  We will check the
INR in the morning and dose Coumadin on the day of transfer
to rehabilitation center.
